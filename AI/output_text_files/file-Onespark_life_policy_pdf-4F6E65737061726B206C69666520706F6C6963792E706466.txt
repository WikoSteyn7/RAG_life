Welcome to OneSpark. We went on a mission to re-engineer, rebuild and redesign life insurance with the sole purpose to put customers first and enable them to better protect themselves and their families. We subsequently created a completely new type of life insurance, a revolutionary product that no longer requires You to lock into a static long term contract, but provides You with needs-matched cover that dynamically adjusts every year to ensure You are always optimally covered should You experience a Life Changing Event. It’s simple. It’s easy. But it dynamically evolves with You as Your needs change, ensuring You only pay for what You need, when You need it. That’s why We call it Pay-As-You-Need Life Insurance. It just makes sense.
A OneSpark Policy enables You to protect Your most valuable assets, Your life, Your income and Your ability to obtain the most advanced treatments should You become severely ill. Our unique and (for many features) world-first products provide broad, comprehensive, efficient and dynamic long- term protection for You and Your family. You receive intelligent, tech-powered cover, unlimited risk cover for unrelated severe illnesses, complete transparency and peace-of-mind through our world- first ShareBack Benefit. Our Life Cover, Lump-Sum Disability Cover, Income Protection and Illness Cover Benefits are fully described in the rest of the Policy Guide.

The Life Cover Benefit provides a Benefit payment to Your Beneficiaries should You die. It can be used to cover all the expected future expenses incurred by Your family. These can be used to pay for such costs as education, healthcare, food, housing, transport and for any other expenses incurred by Your family. A portion can also be used to pay off Your outstanding debts, as well as transfer wealth to Your family members.
This Benefit will pay out 100% of the Life Cover Sum Assured on a valid Claim. Please note that an amount equal to, but not exceeding, the Life Cover Benefit Amount (as specified in Your Policy Schedule) will be paid if You pass away, provided You meet all the required Claims criteria specified throughout this Policy.
Your Benefit Sum Assured will change each year, at Your Policy Anniversary, by the Dynamic Benefit Adjustment, specified by the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis. The Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis is the smart algorithm that calculates Your required cover on an ongoing basis, based on Your individual and unique circumstances. The algorithm automatically and dynamically adjusts Your cover to match Your changing needs as Your life and financial needs change.

All death Claim Events will be covered, except death Claims for any specific Exclusions as specified in section 11.2 or any other Exclusions specified throughout this Policy.
There is a Waiting Period of 60 (sixty) full calendar months for suicide Claims. The Waiting Period applies to cover taken out at the Commencement Date, additional cover taken out through a voluntary servicing change (e.g. voluntary increase in salary, voluntary change in occupation, voluntary increase of cover etc.) during the term of Your Policy and from the reinstatement date of the Policy. The Waiting Period will apply from the date that the cover is successfully added onto the Policy (from the date on which the Insurer accepts the liability). Payouts will only be made for a suicide Claim Event which occurs after the Waiting Period.

Content: Each time You make a voluntary servicing change and increase Your Life Cove Benefit, a new 60 (sixty) month Waiting Period will apply to the additional portion of cover added. The portion of Life Cover Sum Assured that You had before You increased Your cover will be paid out if the Claim is past the original 60 (sixty) month Waiting Period.
Example
Example details:
• You take out a Policy with R5 000 000 Life Cover on 1 July 2020.
• For simplicity, assume the Sum Assured remains level and does not grow in this example.
• Six years later, on 1 July 2026, You add an additional R2 000 000 Life Cover, meaning Your total Life Cover is now R7 000 000.
• Unfortunately, one year later, on 1 July 2027, You pass away and the Claim Event was due to suicide.
In this scenario, the Your Beneficiaries will be paid R5 000 000, since the Claim Event is past the 60 (sixty) months (or five year) Waiting Period for the original Life Cover Sum Assured. However, the R2 000 000 Life Cover added on 1 July 2026 will not be paid out as this portion of Your Life Cover is still in its 60 (sixty) month Waiting Period for suicide Claims.
Please note that increases to Your Life Cover suggested by the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis will only attract a new 60 (sixty) month Waiting Period for suicide Claim Events if the increase in cover is above the maximum allowed servicing limits, at the time of change in cover. Please note that these maximums will be reviewed from time to time and may be amended by the Insurer and/or Administrator, at either’s sole discretion
Payouts will be made only when the Administrator/Insurer are satisfied that all the Policy and Claims requirements are met.

Should the Administrator/Insurer exclude or decline cover for any previous or Pre-Existing Medical Condition, We will not pay out for any Claims that arise under any body system that is directly related to or is a consequence of the conditions or body system that was declined or excluded.
There is no Benefit Expiry Age for the Life Cover Benefit, meaning that the Life Cover Benefit will be provided for Your whole life, as long as You still need Life Cover. The Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis will re-assess the amount of Life Cover required every year to ensure You are always optimally protected.
The Benefit will also cease on a death Claim, as well as any instances where the Policy has been terminated by the Policyholder or by the Insurer, for whatever reason.

Content: Illness Cover Benefit
The Illness Cover Benefit provides a payment if You suffer a severe illness, injury or disease. The payout is in the form of a single cash lump sum and it can be used to cover all unforeseen medical costs, lifestyle changes, assistive medical devices, rehabilitation programmes as well as assisting in accessing new breakthrough global treatments.
The Benefit was designed to ensure that the payout matches the severity of the Claim Event, ensuring You have adequate cover for the impact that the illness or injury is expected to have on Your lifestyle.
Our Illness Cover Benefit pays out an amount commensurate with the change in lifestyle following the Claim Event. This means that the Illness Cover Benefit offers a tiered payout with four severity levels, as follows:
• Severity A: 120% - 200%
• Severity B: 100%
• Severity C: 75%
• Severity D: 50%
Example Details:
• You have an Illness Cover Benefit Sum Assured of R1 000 000.
• You Claim for a Stage IV cancer which qualifies for a Severity B claim (100% payout).
In this scenario, You will receive R1 000 000 = R 1 000 000 x 100%.
Please note that an amount equal to, but not exceeding, the Illness Cover Benefit Amount (as specified in Your Policy Schedule) will be paid if You suffer a valid Claim, under the Illness Objective Medical Criteria in Appendix 2, provided You meet all the required Policy and Claims criteria specified throughout this Policy. In certain circumstances where the Severity percentage is above 100%, We will pay more than the Illness Cover Sum Assured at the time of Claim.

Content:  In certain circumstances where the Severity percentage is above 100%, We will pay more than the Illness Cover Sum Assured at the time of Claim. The definitions found in Appendix 2 may also refer to the Activities of Daily Living definitions and metrics, which can be found in Appendix 3.
The Illness Cover Benefit is a standalone Benefit. This means that Claim payouts from this Benefit will not reduce the Life Cover Sum Assured or any other Benefits on Policy, and that the Benefit can be taken out as a standalone Benefit without the need to have Life Cover on the Policy.

Your Benefit Sum Assured will change each year, at Your Policy Anniversary, by the Dynamic Benefit Adjustment, specified by the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis. The Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis is the smart algorithm that calculates Your required cover on an ongoing basis, based on Your individual and unique circumstances. The algorithm automatically and dynamically adjusts Your cover to match Your changing needs as Your life and financial needs change.
The payout for the Illness Cover Benefit will be equal to the Sum Assured at the Claim Event Date multiplied by the severity percentage.
The Illness Cover Benefit will have a 1 (one) month Survival Period from the Claim Event. This will be 1 (one) full calendar month from the Claim Event Date.
Additionally, there will be a 1 (one) month Waiting Period from the Claim Event Date before the payment may be made to You. This is to give the Administrator/Insurer time to assess the validity and permanence of the Claim Event. This means that Claims will only be paid out at a minimum 1 (one) full calendar month after the Claim Event Date. If further time is required to assess the permanence of a Claim, then the Claim will only be paid out once the medical team of the Administrator/Insurer are satisfied that the condition meets the Illness Objective Medical Criteria. The maximum period for permanence to be established will be 12 (twelve) months from the Claim Event Date.

Content:  The maximum period for permanence to be established will be 12 (twelve) months from the Claim Event Date. Please refer to the definitions in the Illness Objective Medical Criteria (in Appendix 2) to see which conditions specifically require Waiting Periods longer than 1 month to assess the permanence of the illness, injury, disease or condition.
Please note that Premiums must continue to be paid during both the Waiting and Survival Periods, and whilst the Claim is being assessed (up until permanence of the illness, condition or injury is established, that is, up until the date on which the Claim is deemed valid).
Please note that if You survive the 1 (one) month Survival Period, then Your cover will reinstate to the full amount before the Claim Event. Future Unrelated Claims will be paid from this fully reinstated amount, whilst Related and Progressive Claims will only be paid for higher severities using the difference in severity percentages between the latest (current) Claim and the highest of all previous Claims, multiplied by the full Sum Assured. Please see section 14 for more details on multiple claim rules.

Content: Example
Example Details:
• You take out R1 000 000 Illness Cover.
• Unfortunately, 2 years later, You Claim for a stage III cancer.
• You qualify for a 100% pay out.
This means We will pay out R1 000 000 x 100% = R1 000 000.
If You survive the one-month Survival Period, then the Sum Assured will increase back to the full R1 000 000. This is because You will still have full coverage for all future Unrelated Claims that is, You will receive a payout based on the full Sum Assured and the relevant severity for all for all future Unrelated Claims.
–
As mentioned above, if You survive the 1 (one) month Survival Period, then Your cover will reinstate to the full amount before the Claim Event Date. Illness Cover Premiums will also continue to be paid in full thereafter – that is, the Premium payable will be for 100% of the full reinstated Illness Cover Sum Assured.
If an Illness Cover Claim is Repudiated (for whatever reason), then the Illness Cover Benefit and Illness Cover Premiums will continue to be paid thereafter. This is done so that You continue to be protected, should You experience a Claim Event in the future.
Should the Administrator/Insurer exclude or decline cover for any previous or Pre-Existing Medical Condition, We will not pay out for any Claim Events that arise under any body system that is directly related to or is a consequence of the conditions or body system that was declined or excluded.

Content: 6. Disability Cover Benefit
The Disability Cover Benefit provides a payment if You become Permanently Disabled. The payout is made as a single cash lump sum and it can be used to cover Your expected future lost income and/or all the expected future expenses incurred by You and Your family. These can be used to pay for such costs as education, healthcare, food, housing, transport and for any other expenses incurred by You and Your family. This payment is made as a single lump sum payment to You. The lump sum, or a portion thereof, can also be used to pay off any of Your outstanding debts, if so required.
This Benefit will pay out 100% of the Disability Cover Benefit Sum Assured on a valid Claim. An amount equal to, but not exceeding, the Disability Cover Benefit Sum Assured (as specified in Your Policy Schedule) will be paid if You suffer a valid Claim, under the Disability Objective Medical Criteria or the Occupational Claims Criteria and provided You meet all other Policy requirements.
This Benefit is a standalone Benefit. This means that any Claim amount from this Benefit will not reduce the Life Cover Sum Assured or any other Benefits on the Policy.
Your Benefit Sum Assured will change each year, at Your Policy Anniversary, by the Dynamic Benefit Adjustment, specified by the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis.

The Disability Objective Medical Criteria is an objective, transparent and fair Claim system used to assess the severity of Your disability. The disability is assessed based on the severity of Your medical impairment.
Occupational Claims Criteria
The Benefit will pay out if Your disability meets the Occupational Claims Criteria definition.
Please note that the Occupational Claims Criteria is not available for certain occupations. Please refer to Your Policy Schedule to see if Your occupation qualifies for the Occupational Claim Criteria.
Please note that chronic fatigue syndrome (and any manifestations thereof), fibromyalgia (or conditions similar thereto), chronic pain disorders, any Mental and Behavioural Conditions and any lower back conditions are excluded under the Occupational Claims Criteria. The lower back Exclusion is defined as follows: No amount or Sum Assured under this Benefit shall be payable for a disability which is caused wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, by an injury to, or a disorder of Lumbar Sacral spine or any complications thereof.
Please note that You will still be able to claim for Mental and Behavioural or lower back conditions if You meet one of the Disability Objective Medical Criteria definitions.
Please note that the maximum specified timeframe for the Claims assessment under the Disability Objective Medical Criteria or Occupational Claims Criteria is 12 (twelve) months from the Claim Event Date (longer periods will be allowed if specifically specified in any of the individual Disability Objective Medical Criteria definitions).

Please note that there is a 1 (one) month Waiting and Survival Period from the Claim Event:
• The 1 (one) month Survival Period means that a client will need to survive 1 (one) full calendar month from the Claim Event Date in order for a Claim to be made.
• In order to give the Insurer time to assess the validity and permanence of the Claim Event, there will be a 1 (one) month Waiting Period from the Claim Event. This means that Claims will only be paid out at a minimum of 1 (one) month after the Claim Event Date. Further time may be required to assess the permanence of a Claim Event and the Claim will only be paid out once the Administrator/Insurer are satisfied that the Claim condition meets the Permanent Disability Claims definition.

If the Claim is repudiated, then the Disability Cover Benefit and Premiums will both continue to ensure You remain protected if You were to experience a Claim Event going forward.
Please note that no Claim payout will be made if the Claim Event condition is due to an Exclusion, as defined in section 11.2. Certain condition specific/category specific Exclusions can also be found in Appendix 1.
Please also note that no multiple Claims will be allowed under the Disability Cover Benefit. This means that once 100% of the Benefit Sum Assured is paid out, then no further Claim payments will be made from the Disability Cover Benefit.
Should the Insurer exclude or decline cover for any previous or Pre-Existing Medical Condition, We will not pay out for any Claims that arise under any body system that is directly related to or is a consequence of the conditions or body system that was declined or excluded.
The Benefit will cease when
• The Life Insured dies; or
• The Policy has been terminated by any party, for whatever reason; or
• A valid Disability Cover Benefit Claim has occurred; or
• The Life Insured turns age 65 (sixty-five).
If You still have outstanding debt at age 65 (sixty-five), then Your Benefit will not expire when You turn 65 (sixty-five) and may be extended until the end of the month in which You turn 70 (seventy). The following paragraphs detail how this works.
If You still have outstanding debt when You are 65 (sixty-five) and You want to keep Your Disability Cover to cover this debt, then You will need to send Us proof of the outstanding debt before the first Policy Anniversary before You turn 65 (sixty-five).

If no proof of outstanding debt is received by the Administrator/Insurer from You by the Policy Anniversary when You turn 65 (sixty-five), the Disability Cover Benefit will automatically fall away when You turn 65 (sixty-five) and You will not be able to reinstate the Disability Cover Benefit thereafter. Proof of outstanding debt will need to be provided to the Administrator/Insurer on an annual basis before each Policy Anniversary to keep the cover in force. The cover that You take out cannot exceed the outstanding debt amount provided at that point in time. It also cannot exceed the Disability Cover Sum Assured at Your previous Policy Anniversary, as well as the Disability Cover Sum Assured at the point in time when You turned 65 (sixty-five).

Content: The Income Protection Benefit is a Benefit which pays You a regular Income should You experience an illness, disease, impairment or injury preventing You from working and earning an Income. It consists of 2 (two) income protection components. These are the:
• Temporary Income Protection Benefit – This Benefit will provide protection in situations where You are unable to perform your Nominated Occupation and are losing income, but are not deemed Permanently Disabled, and the
• Permanent Income Protection Benefit – This Benefit will provide protection on Permanent Disability Claims.
The Temporary Income Protection Benefit pays You a regular income should You experience an illness, disease, impairment or injury preventing You from working and earning an Income upon becoming Temporarily Disabled and where You are unable to perform Your own Nominated Occupation. This Benefit is used to replace lost Income when You cannot work and cannot earn an Income as a result of a Temporary Disability.
The Benefit is designed to complement the Permanent Income Protection Benefit, which only pays on Permanent Disability. Please see section 7.2 for further details.
An amount equal to, but not exceeding, the Temporary Income Protection Benefit Sum Assured (as specified in Your Policy Schedule) will be paid if You suffer a valid Claim Event under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit.

Please note that the above adjustments are made when You are not claiming under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit. The In-Claim Escalations (increases) can be found in section 7.3.4.
A payout for a valid Claim under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit will be defined as the lesser of Your Temporary Income Protection Benefit Sum Assured and Your Pre- Claim Income at the Claim Event Date. Payments will only be made for full Days that You qualify for payouts under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit.
The first payment to You will be made at the end of the month in which the Waiting Period expires. Thereafter, Benefit payments will always be made at the end of the month.
Under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit, You can claim under the Loss of Income Claims Criteria by providing proof that You are unable to perform at least 25% of the main duties of Your Nominated Occupation due to injury or illness, and as a result are unable to maintain Your income level.
The Claim payment that You receive will depend on the Income that you are losing whilst You are in claim. If You suffer a partial loss of income, You will be paid a proportionate claim payment which will equal the Temporary Income Protection Sum Assured multiplied by the proportion of Income lost.
Whilst You are in claim, Your Temporary Income Protection Benefit Premiums will be waived, that is, You will not pay any Temporary Income Protection Benefit Premiums during claim.

Whilst You are in claim, Your Temporary Income Protection Benefit Premiums will be waived, that is, You will not pay any Temporary Income Protection Benefit Premiums during claim. Even if You are only claiming for a portion of Your income, Your Temporary Income Protection Premiums will be waived, that is, You do not need to be claiming for 100% of Your Temporary Income Protection Benefit Sum Assured to have Your Temporary Income Protection Benefit Premiums waived.
However, during claim, You will continue to pay Premiums for other Benefits (i.e. for Life Cover, Disability Cover, Illness Cover and Permanent Income Protection). If You do not pay the Premiums for these Benefits, they will fall away.
There is a 1 (one) or 3 (three) month Waiting Period for the Temporary Income Protection Benefit. Please refer to Your Schedule to see which Waiting Period applies to Your Policy. This means that this Benefit will only pay out after the Waiting Period has expired and only once the Administrator/Insurer are satisfied that You have satisfied the Temporary Income Protection Benefit claims criteria.
The Temporary Income Protection Benefit pays out, as long as the Benefit remains in force, until the earlier of:
• You have recovered sufficiently to return to work;
• The end of the month in which You turn age 65 (sixty-five);
• Your death;

7.1.6 Things to note
Please note that:
• Temporary Income Protection Benefit Claims will be subject to an overall maximum Claim amount. Please refer to Your Policy Schedule for this maximum amount. The maximum amount will be reviewed annually and may be amended by the Insurer and/or Administrator, at either’s sole discretion.
• Occupations affect the Premiums charged – if Your occupation changes, the Administrator/Insurer requests that You inform Us. We reserve the right to amend Your Premiums and/or Benefits should You alter Your occupation to one considered to be of a higher risk than your previous occupation. The classification of whether the new occupation is deemed to be a higher risk occupation will be made at the sole discretion of the Administrator/Insurer.
• The OneSpark Policy is a living, dynamic Policy which changes as You and the world around You changes. This means it evolves and updates with the changing medical landscape. Therefore, the Administrator and/or Insurer reserves the right, from time to time and at either of their sole discretion, to review and amend the claims criteria under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit, after consultation with medical experts. Amendments may be due to, but are not limited to, changes in the relevance, prognosis, occurrence, survival rates, recovery rates, mortality rates (following the onset of the condition) and lifestyle impacts of different illnesses, diseases or injuries as well as of different claim underpins. This means that the Administrator and/or Insurer may add or remove claims criteria under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit, from time to time at their sole discretion.

Content: PERMANENT INCOME PROTECTION BENEFIT
The Permanent Income Protection Benefit pays You a regular income should You experience a disease, illness, impairment or injury preventing You from working and earning an Income upon becoming Permanently Disabled. This Benefit is used to replace lost Income when You cannot work and cannot earn an Income as a result of suffering a Permanent Disability Claim Event.
The Permanent Income Protection Benefit is designed to complement the Temporary Income Protection Benefit, which pays on Temporary Disability, where the Permanent Income Protection Benefit will begin to pay out once permanence is established.
7.2.2 Overview
Please note that an amount equal to, but not exceeding, the Permanent Income Protection Benefit Sum Assured (as specified in Your Policy Schedule) will be paid if You suffer a valid Claim Event under the Permanent Income Protection Benefit.
Please note that valid Benefit payouts will not reduce the Life Cover Sum Assured or any other Benefits on Claim.
Your Benefit Sum Assured will change each year, at Your Policy Anniversary, by the Dynamic Benefit Adjustment, specified by the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis. The algorithm automatically and dynamically adjusts Your cover to match Your changing needs as Your life and financial needs change. Your Permanent Income Protection Benefit Sum Assured will grow in line with Your projected net of tax Salary, as projected by the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis.

relation to the Waiting Period. In other words, the Claim payouts only commence after the expiration of the Waiting Period and will only be paid in respect of the period after the Waiting Period expires.
Please note that the usual Dynamic Benefit Adjustment will be applied to the Temporary and Permanent Income Protection Benefit Sum Assureds if Your Policy Anniversary either comes before the end of the Waiting Period or coincides with it (but also which is after the Date of Disability). No other Policy changes will be allowed in the time period from the Date of Disability until the end of the Waiting Period or until permanence is established, whichever comes later.
Note that only full Days which You satisfy the Claims criteria contribute towards the Waiting Period.
If You recover or are rehabilitated and Claim again for the same cause which resulted in Your original inability to perform Your Nominated Occupation within 3 (three) months of recovery, the Waiting Period will be waived for the subsequent Claim.

7.3.4 In-Claim Escalation
The In-Claim Escalation Factor is the percentage that the Temporary and Permanent Income Protection Benefits will increase by each year, at Your Claim Anniversary.
Please note there are 2 (two) claim escalation options, namely the:
• CPI option
• Occupational In-Claim Escalation Option, which has 3 (three) categories:
- Core Option
- Standard Option
- Executive Option
These all apply an increase of CPI plus a certain factor to take into account the Claimants age as well as expected future occupational increases relating to their specific occupation. The category within the Occupational In-Claim Escalation Option will be automatically applied to Your Policy based on Your Nominated Occupation.
Please refer to Your Policy Schedule to see which option has been selected on Your Policy.
Depending on the option selected, each year on the Claim Anniversary Date, the Temporary and Permanent Income Protection Benefit Sum Assureds will increase by a specified factor. The specified factor will be based on the following factors:
• CPI
• Your Nominated Occupation
• Your age each year in claim
The In-Claim Escalation increase option look as follows:

Below are some scenarios when both the Temporary Income Protection and Permanent Income Protection Benefits Claim payouts may be different, owing to scenarios where aggregation takes place against income earned and other income protection policies. These are as follows:
7.3.7.1 Claim Amount when aggregating against income earned
You may not receive more than 100% of Your Pre-Claim Income (or Your Sum Assured, whichever is less) when taking into account the Benefit Amount that the Administrator pays out to You plus income earned, whilst in claim.
In order to assist clients in returning to work and getting the treatment they require, for the first 6 (six) months post Claim Event, the Administrator encourages clients to go back to work and allows them to earn in excess of 100% of their Pre-Claim Income or Claim Amount (whichever is lower at Claims stage).

In order to assist clients in returning to work and getting the treatment they require, for the first 6 (six) months post Claim Event, the Administrator encourages clients to go back to work and allows them to earn in excess of 100% of their Pre-Claim Income or Claim Amount (whichever is lower at Claims stage).
These months are the total period since the Claim Event Date. This means the period for the actual payout is the number of months specified below minus the Waiting Period duration. So, 6 (six) months in the table below with a 1 (one) month Waiting Period means 5 (five) months of payments.
The Administrator will only ever pay out a maximum of 100% of Your Pre-Claim Income or Claim Amount (whichever is lower at Claims stage) in all cases, that is, the Administrator will never pay more than 100% of the amount defined in sections 7.1.4 and 7.2.4 above.
The Administrator will aggregate the Claim amount against income earned for all Claims assessed under both the Temporary and Permanent Disability Claims criteria. Income will be aggregated in all scenarios, irrespective of whether You are working in Your Nominated Occupation or any other occupation (or job) during Claim.
The payment calculation by the Administrator is as follows:

• Rent;
• Dividends;
• However, dividends payable by a private company/close corporation of which You are the owner and in terms of which You actively participate (after Your disability) in the management of the company will be included.

You must notify the Administrator/Insurer if You start earning an income while a Claim is in payment. Should the Administrator/Insurer determine that We were not notified of this while a Claim was in payment, the Administrator/Insurer may recover any amount that was paid in excess of the amount that would have been paid if You had notified Us that You were earning an income.
7.3.7.2 Claim Amount when receiving other income protection benefits
If You receive disability income or sickness benefits from other policies (either from the Administrator or any other insurers) and these benefits together with Your Claim amount (as defined in sections 7.1.4 and 7.2.4) exceed 100% of Your Pre-Claim Income, the payment made to You will be adjusted proportionately. The formula to calculate the adjusted payment is as follows:
Adjusted Claim Amount for other Benefits = Min {[(Claim Amount) / (Claim Amount + benefit amounts from other disability income or sickness Benefits)] x 100% of the Pre-Claim Income, Claim Amount}
Claim Amount is the Temporary or Permanent Income Protection Benefit Claim amount defined in sections 7.1.4 and 7.2.4.

This adjustment will apply up to the end of the Temporary and Permanent Income Protection payment periods (as described in section 7) .
Under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit, reassessments of the Claimants ability (or inability) to perform their Nominated Occupation are allowed at any time, at the Administrator or Insurer’s sole discretion. This will be performed on a case-by-case basis.
Under the Permanent Income Protection Benefit, reassessments of the Claimants ability (or inability) to perform their Nominated Occupation are allowed at any time, at the Administrator or Insurer’s sole discretion. This will be performed on a case-by-case basis.
If You travel or move outside South Africa while a Claim is in payment, and We require proof that You are still disabled and still have a loss of Income (where relevant), We will require the medical and financial proof issued in a foreign country to be in English.
• You will be primarily responsible for the cost of medical proof. We will refund You in South African currency for an amount equal to what We usually pay for such medical proof in South Africa.
• You will be responsible for the cost of financial proof of loss of Income, where required.
• The amount paid will always be in the local currency of South Africa.
We will make Benefit payments for disability and loss of Income in a foreign country for a maximum period of 12 (twelve) months.

10.1.4 Things to note
Please note that the all rules, terms, conditions, costs (including parties responsible for the different cost) and Benefit workings specified throughout this section (section 10.1) will be reviewed from time to time and may be amended by the Insurer and/or Administrator, at either’s sole discretion.
10.2.1 What is the purpose of the Benefit?
As You get older and retirement nears, Your need for financial protection typically reduces, meaning that the need for certain Benefits, such as Life and Disability Cover, reduces. In line with smart financial planning, our algorithm automatically converts unneeded cover on Your Policy into additional Illness Cover, which can be used to pay for additional healthcare costs as You near retirement as well as in retirement. This additional cover, provided with no additional underwriting, can be used to cover the costs of a nurse, a nursing home, or any new age technology and/or medicine that is required in retirement.
10.2.2 Overview
This is an automatic feature on the Policy. If Your Life or Disability Cover start to reduce in line with the Your financial needs as You near retirement, We will seamlessly channel that unused risk cover into further Illness Cover, on an annual basis.

Content:  If Your Life or Disability Cover start to reduce in line with the Your financial needs as You near retirement, We will seamlessly channel that unused risk cover into further Illness Cover, on an annual basis. This cover will be converted free of any medical underwriting and free of any further questionnaires.
10.2.3 How does it work?
The amount of Illness Cover that will be converted will depend on the reduction in the Life Cover and Disability Cover Benefit Sum Assureds, as they change in line with Your needs. The conversion will occur automatically each year at Your Policy Anniversary,
The amount of Illness Cover that will be converted will equal the average reduction of Your Life Cover and Disability Cover Benefit Sum Assureds. For example:
Amount of Illness Cover converted = Maximum [(Reduction in the Life Cover Sum Assured + Reduction Disability Cover Sum Assured) ÷ 2, 0]
The Premium charged for the converted Illness Cover will be the new business Illness Cover Premium at the time of conversion. This will be an automatic Benefit on the Policy,

Content: but You can always reduce Your Illness Cover Benefit Sum Assured if You do not want the additional Illness Cover.
The additional converted Illness Cover will increase in line with the Dynamic Benefit Adjustments applied to the Illness Cover Benefit, as described in section 5.
Example
Example Details:
• When You turn age 60, You have:
o R1 000 000 Life Cover
o R1 500 000 Disability Cover
o R500 000 Illness Cover
• At Policy Anniversary, Your financial needs have reduced as You near retirement as You have paid off Your mortgage and Your children have become independent. Thus, the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis proposes a reduction in the amount of Life and Disability Cover that You have from R1 000 000 and R1 500 000, to R900 000 and R1 300 000, respectively.
• Your Illness Cover continues to increase with the Dynamic Benefit Adjustment.
• Assume CPI is equal to 5% in this example.
The amount of Illness Cover converted is:
Amount of Illness Cover converted = (Reduction in Disability Cover Sum Assured +
Reduction Illness Cover Sum Assured) ÷ 2
= ((R1 000 000 - R900 000) + (R1 500 000 – R1 300 000)) ÷ 2
= (R100 000 + R200 000) ÷2
= R150 000
Your new Illness Cover Sum Assured is:
New Illness Cover Sum Assured = Old Illness Cover Sum Assured x (1 + CPI) + Amount of Illness Cover converted
= R500 000 x (1 + 5%) + R150 000
= R525 000 + R150 000
= R675 000
The new additional R150 000 Sum Assured tranche will be purchased at the new business Premiums at that particular point in time.
Please note that all rules relating to the original Illness Cover will automatically apply to the converted Illness Cover Sum Assured.

• The same Waiting and Survival Periods will be applied to the converted Illness Cover as was applied to the original Illness Cover Benefit on the Policy beforehand.
• Any other Exclusions that apply to other Benefits on Your Policy or at a Policy level will also apply to the converted Illness Cover. This means that if You have a condition-specific, Benefit specific or any other policy specific Exclusions on Your Policy, these same Exclusions will also apply to the converted Illness Cover.
This automatic conversion of Life Cover and/or Disability Cover to Illness Cover will apply on each Policy Anniversary starting from the first Policy Anniversary 10 (ten) full years before Your Benefit Expiry Age. For example, if the Benefit Expiry Age is 65 (sixty-five) then, this conversion will begin from the time You turn age 55 (fifty-five). This is to gradually channel value over a 10 (ten) year period, starting from the first Policy Anniversary before Your 55th (fifty-fifth) birthday to the last Policy Anniversary before Your 65th (sixty-fifth) birthday.
Please note that if You have any medical or health loadings and/or any medical or health related Exclusions on any of the Benefits on Your Policy, this conversion facility will not be available on Your Policy.
Before Your cover converts, We will perform certain checks to ensure You meet the minimum criteria for using the conversion:
• You must have held Your Policy for at least 3 (three) years;
- You cannot use the cover conversion facility if You’ve held Your cover for less than 3 (three) years, counted from the Commencement Date.

• If You have submitted a Claim that is still being assessed:
- You will not be able to convert cover until the Claim decision has been finalised.
- If the Claim is valid, then the conversion feature will fall away going forward backdated from the Claim Event Date, and no conversion will be allowed at that Policy Anniversary (when the Claim was still being assessed).
- If the Claim is not valid, then the conversion feature will be allowed going forward. However, no conversion will be allowed at previous Policy Anniversary (when the Claim was still being assessed).
Please note that limits may apply to the cover that You convert with the cover conversion facility:
• Maximum value of converted cover:
- These amounts are subject to the overall Illness Cover Benefit maximums, set by the Administrator/Insurer from time to time, at either’s sole discretion.
• No previous Illness Cover was taken:
- If You did not take out cover under the Illness Cover Benefit at Policy Commencement Date or at any time before the first conversion date, then the converted Illness Cover Benefit will exclude any claims for Pre-Existing Conditions or any claims for conditions, procedures or complications related to a Pre-Existing Condition.

The monthly Income amount that You insure/protect (for Your Nominated Occupation) must be what You derive from Your Nominated Occupation that You’ve specified, or must be the monthly Income in respect of Your Nominated Occupation that You’ve specified.
Please note that Your Nominated Occupation affect the Premiums You are charged. If Your occupation changes, We request that You inform Us.

of Income, at any time, if We suspect any fraud or Misrepresentation by the Life Insured (or any representative of the Life Insured) on the Policy, at any point during the Policy term.
Although the Policy provides lifetime protection (as long as Your Policy remains in force), Your cover and Premiums will be reviewed at least annually. The cover will change to account for the fact Your needs vary on an annual basis and should change in line with Your evolving needs. This is in line with OneSpark’s philosophy of not locking You into a static long-term contract, but rather varying Your cover every year to ensure that Your actual cover is equal to Your needs at that point.
This will work by communicating to You 31 (thirty-one) Days prior to Your anniversary (see section 13) that You should review Your financial needs to ensure Your Cover Amounts are correct. You will be asked to answer a few questions on the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis about Your current circumstances. If You do not answer the questionnaire, then Your cover will change in line with the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis algorithm, that is, the relevant Sum Assureds (for each Benefit) will change with the proposed Dynamic Benefit Adjustments to align with Your projected changing needs.

Example
You, aged 30, take out a OneSpark Policy, on 1 January 2021. You are married but do not have any children. At Commencement Date, OneSpark’s algorithm proposes R1,000,000 Life Cover and R500,000 Disability Cover to cover Your financial needs. Your monthly Premium would be R100 for your Life Cover benefit and R50 for Your Disability Cover Benefit. You decide to take out the recommended cover. You will pay these Premiums for the calendar year of 2021.
On 1 December 2021, You receive an Anniversary letter stating that You should review Your financial needs to ensure Your Cover Amounts remain relevant. You will have the choice to update these details or not.
The Anniversary letter will also contain what Your Cover Amounts will change to, based on OneSpark’s unique algorithm if no input is received. The algorithm uses all Your unique characteristics and projects forward to try replicate Your unique situation as far as possible, to match Your changing needs.
Scenario 1
You decide to update the details around Your financial needs. In this scenario, all Your financial needs remain the same, except that You have a child during the year. This means Your financial needs have increased. If You were to pass away, You would need to leave money for Your Spouse as well as Your new born child.
Therefore, You will require more Life and Disability Cover to cover these needs.

You can decide if You would like this cover or not. If not, you can keep your existing cover in place. If You decide to take the new cover, then a new Policy Anniversary letter will be sent to You confirming the changes.
Scenario 2
You decide to not update the details around Your financial needs. In this scenario, Your Cover Amounts and Premiums will automatically change in line with OneSpark’s unique algorithm as indicated on Your Policy Anniversary letter. In this example (without inputs), the algorithm proposes that You require R1,180,000 Life Cover and R590,000 Disability Cover. Your Premium is expected to be R118 for Life Cover and R59 for Disability Cover.
Your Benefit and Premium will automatically adjust in line with the changes, but You can always amend Your cover, if so required.
If You would like to change certain individual details on Your Policy, then You must inform the Administrator/Insurer of these changes:
• Changing smoking status
• Change of highest education level
• Change of occupation
• Change of hazardous pursuits
• Change of Income
These changes may lead to a change of Premium or Benefits offered (for example, amendments may be made to Your Occupational Claim Criteria).

The OneSpark Life Policy works in a transparent manner. We take a flat percentage to cover expenses, pay taxes, set up actuarial reserves, help us grow and cover various other costs associated with administration of policies. During the year, all valid claims are paid out by the Insurer and at the end of the year, We will give back whatever’s leftover after paying all valid claims, all reinsurance costs and setting up the required reserves and provisions.

12.2 HOW DOES IT WORK?
From each Premium paid to the Insurer, We take a flat percentage to cover expenses, pay taxes, set up actuarial reserves and cover various other costs associated with administration of policies. The remaining percentage is set aside and used to cover valid claims.
Whatever is left over after claims, reserves, provisions, and reinsurance costs at the ShareBack Payout Date, which we will determine in our sole discretion each year and if applicable in each year, will be paid proportionately back to qualifying Policyholders. The ShareBack payout, where applicable, will always made directly to the Policyholder.
The amount We will pay back to each policyholder is based on the premiums that each individual policyholder has paid during any ShareBack Calculation Period relative to the total premiums received by the Insurer (from policies who are eligible to receive ShareBacks) in the given ShareBack Calculation Period. Please note that only policyholders in force at the ShareBack Payout Date will receive an amount from the ShareBack Benefit.

Content:  Please note that only policyholders in force at the ShareBack Payout Date will receive an amount from the ShareBack Benefit.
Please refer to Your Policy Schedule to see the ShareBack Calculation Period on Your Policy.
The ShareBack Benefit payout remains discretionary and is dependent on the performance of the book of policies, including factors such as scale (number of policies) and claims experience. For example, if the annual claims experience is worse than expected (or as expected), then no ShareBacks will be paid out to the remaining policyholders. In this scenario, all valid claims will still be paid out. If the annual claims experience is better than expected, then whatever money is left, after deducting all relevant costs, will be distributed to the remaining policyholders.
The ShareBack payouts on Your Policy may be subject to taxation. It is your responsibility to speak to a tax practitioner for advice. We are not responsible for any consequences if You fail to ask a tax practitioner for advice or if You fail to pay the applicable tax.

Content: If You cancel Your Policy during the year, before the ShareBack Payout Date has been determined, then You will not receive a payout at the ShareBack Payout Date. This means payouts will only be paid to clients who have their Policy in force at the ShareBack Payout Date. If You cancel and re-enter within a 2 (two) month period (that is, if You reinstate Your Policy within 2 (two) months from the original cancellation date) then You will be eligible for the ShareBack Benefit in that year. In all other scenarios, if You cancel and re-enter, then You will not be eligible for the ShareBack Benefit in that same year. However, for all other years going forward, You may still be eligible for the ShareBack Benefit.
ShareBacks are only paid to clients who haven’t claimed in that particular year. This means that clients who have claimed will not receive a ShareBack payout if a ShareBack is applicable. ‘A client who claims’ is classified as a client who claims for any of the following Benefits (for any length of time), under any of their respective Benefit Claim Event definitions:
• Life Cover
• Disability Cover
• Illness Cover
• Income Protection Benefit (Temporary and Permanent Income Protection Benefits)
• Standalone Temporary Income Protection
• Accidental Benefits (Death and Disability)
Clients who have claimed under any of the Benefits above will not be eligible for ShareBacks in the years that they have claimed, but they may still be able to receive ShareBacks in the years going forward (provided they have stopped claiming and have sufficiently recovered and returned to work, where applicable).
Example 1
You start claiming under the Income Protection Benefit (under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit) on the 1st July 2020.

Example 1
You start claiming under the Income Protection Benefit (under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit) on the 1st July 2020. You claim until the 30th November 2020.
In this scenario, You will not be eligible for ShareBacks in 2020, but will be eligible for ShareBacks for the year 2021 (provided that You don’t claim for any Benefit on the policy in that year and Your Policy is in force). You will also be eligible for ShareBacks for the years thereafter, provided that You do not claim for any Benefit on the policy in those years. Each year will be assessed in isolation.
Example 2
You start claiming under the Income Protection Benefit (under the Temporary Income Protection Benefit) on the 1st July 2020. You claim until the 30th November 2021. On 1 December 2021, You return to work since You has sufficiently recovered.
In this scenario, You will not be eligible for ShareBacks in 2020 and 2021 but will be eligible for ShareBacks for the year 2022 (provided that You do not claim for any Benefit on Your Policy in that year and Your Policy is in force). You will also be eligible for ShareBacks for the years

thereafter, provided that You do not claim for any Benefit on the policy in those years. Each year will be assessed in isolation.
Please note that if You have submitted a Claim at the ShareBack Payout Date and no decision has been made as yet (at the ShareBack Payout Date), You will still receive a ShareBack payout for that particular year. If the Claim is valid in the following year and a Claim payout is made, then You will not be eligible to receive any ShareBacks in that year and the Claim payout amount made to You will be reduced by the ShareBack payout that You received whilst the Claim was being assessed. If the Claim is repudiated, then You will be eligible to receive ShareBacks in that year. In either scenario, You will be eligible for ShareBack payouts after the year that the Claim decision is finalised and where a Claim payout has been made.
Please note that when You remove a Benefit or reduce cover, You will still be eligible to receive a payout from the ShareBack Benefit at the ShareBack Payout Date. The return will be proportional to the Premiums You paid during that year relative to the total Premiums received by the Insurer.
Any cover increases or decreases during the year will be taken into account through the calculation described in the paragraph above.
If You have Premiums in arrears at the ShareBack Payout Date, then You will also not be eligible to receive any ShareBacks.

Content: 
If You have Premiums in arrears at the ShareBack Payout Date, then You will also not be eligible to receive any ShareBacks. If You pay back the outstanding Premiums prior to confirmation from Us of the Shareback Payout Date, then You will be eligible for ShareBacks. If You do not pay back the outstanding Premiums within the grace period and before the confirmation from Us of the Shareback Payout Date, then all ShareBacks that could be owing to You will be forfeited.
You will also not be eligible for ShareBacks if the Administrator and/or Insurer cancels Your Policy, for whatever reason, or suspects any form of Misrepresentation or fraud by You or anyone acting on Your behalf (at any point up to and including the ShareBack Payout Date).
Please note that if there is no money left, after deducting all costs specified in sections 12.1 and 12.2, at the ShareBack Payout Date, then no ShareBacks will be paid out. This scenario could happen when, for example, the sum of all claims for all OneSpark policyholders are more than all premiums received from all policyholders. In this scenario, OneSpark’s reinsurer will pay for all valid Claims, meaning that valid Claims will always be paid out.
This means that this Benefit is not guaranteed in any particular year and is solely dependent on the specified criteria confirmed above.
The ShareBack Benefit is an automatic Benefit on Your Policy, at no extra cost to Yourself.

Content: 13. Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis
The Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis is the smart algorithm that calculates Your required cover on an ongoing basis, based on Your individual and unique circumstances. The algorithm dynamically adjusts to match Your changing needs as Your life and financial needs change.
The Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis utilises the latest technology to meet Your evolving financial needs as closely as possible. It increases faster than inflation in Your younger years as Your earning potential increases and liabilities accrue, and less than inflation in Your older years as liabilities are settled and expenses reduce. Eventually, it starts to reduce as liabilities are paid off and You approach retirement. It attempts to cover You as optimally as possible (assuming You selected the Cover suggested by the algorithm) such that if You suffer a Claim Event, You (or Your family) will be left in the same financial position as if You didn’t experience the Claim Event.
The Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis will propose a certain amount of cover for Benefits on the OneSpark Life Policy, depending on Your unique circumstances at each point in time. Benefits will run for a duration of 1 (one) year from Policy Anniversary to Policy Anniversary (unless You updated Your individual details or make Policy changes during the year). Thereafter, at each Policy Anniversary, Your Benefits will recalculate and re-adjust to match Your updated financial Needs at that point.

Content:  Thereafter, at each Policy Anniversary, Your Benefits will recalculate and re-adjust to match Your updated financial Needs at that point. This ensures that You are always as optimally protected as possible, given Your circumstances at that point in time as well as the information supplied to Us by You.
Each year at the Policy Anniversary, each Benefit on the Policy will adjust in line with Your changing circumstances. The annual adjustment percentage is called the Dynamic Benefit Adjustment, which will adjust to the level proposed by the algorithm of the Dynamic Financial Needs Analysis.
In line with the fact that different needs require different Benefit adjustments, each Benefit on Your Policy will receive a different Dynamic Benefit Adjustment each year to ensure that Your financial needs are holistically updated, so that You and Your family are as optimally protected as possible throughout Your life.
Please note that the Premiums for each Benefit will adjust each year, at the Policy Anniversary, in line with the changing Dynamic Benefit Adjustments for that specific Benefit, as well as a factor to take into account Your increasing age. The Dynamic Premium Adjustments will be different for each Benefit, depending on how the specific Benefit is adjusted each year in line with Your changing needs.

13.4 DYNAMIC SALARY INCREASES
The algorithm is smart and will automatically adjust Your salary each year, at Policy Anniversary, if no input is received, which will be based on Your specific occupation, Your age and the various economic factors (this includes, but is not limited to, inflation). The adjustments have been calculated for people just like You, at Your current life stage and for Your specific occupation, to replicate as far as possible the salary growth patterns of Your specific occupation, taking into account such things as Your expected promotional increases and various economic factors. This ensures that even if no input is received from You regarding Your updated monthly salary at Your Policy Anniversary each year, the algorithm will still provide (as close to possible) the optimal amount of coverage for someone in Your unique circumstance.
As Your gross salary increases each year, Your net of tax salary will also increase. The increases to Your gross salary may be different to the increases to Your net salary. This is because as Your gross salary increases, the tax bracket You fall into may change and thus the tax You pay may change.
CPI is used in most calculations in some form or another.
The CPI figure used throughout the Policy and in all the calculations is subject to an overall maximum of 10% each year, unless otherwise specified.

The CPI figure used throughout the Policy and in all the calculations is subject to an overall maximum of 10% each year, unless otherwise specified. This maximum will be reviewed, for each individual Benefit, annually by the Administrator and may be amended by the Administrator, at its sole discretion. This means that the Administrator reserves the right to change this maximum CPI percentage for different Benefits, at its sole discretion.
13.6 GENERAL RULES

14. Claims
OneSpark was started with the sole purpose of creating a transparent, fair and objective life insurance structure that optimally aligns the client and the Insurer’s interests. Additionally, with our innovative and transparent structure, We return all unused risk premiums at the end of the year (where it is determined to be applicable) through the ShareBack Benefit, as described in section 12.
It is also why We have comprehensive Claims criteria covering both Objective Medical Criteria, which removes any subjectivity from the claims decision process, as well as Benefit specific criteria, covering such things as the inability to perform Your Nominated Occupation, Loss of Income and Activities of Daily Living Criteria. Our broad range of Claims underpins ensures maximum protection for You and Your family.
This section describes what happens on Your Policy after a specific Benefit Claim has occurred.
Please note that for Benefits which remain on the Policy post Claim, Premiums for those Benefits must be paid in order for those Benefits to remain on the Policy (unless specified otherwise in this Policy). If Premiums are no longer paid for those Benefits, those Benefits will fall away and no further protection will be provided by them.
After a Life Cover Claim Event

Content: • Unrelated Claims: A subsequent Unrelated Claim will be paid out, regardless if the severity of the new Unrelated Claim is higher or lower than the previous Unrelated Claim severity. In this case, the Claim payout amount is calculated as the full percentage payout, multiplied by the Benefit Amount.
• Related and Progressive Claims: A subsequent Claim will only be paid if the Claim Event is more severe than a previous Related or Progressive Claim. The Claim Amount that We pay is based on the difference between the percentage payout for the new Claim and the highest percentage paid for the previous Claim/s. In this case, the Claim amount is calculated as the additional percentage payout, multiplied by the Benefit Amount.

Content: 4.1 Multiple Benefit Claims
Multiple Benefit Claims arise when You qualify for payments from 2 (two) or more Benefits, as a result of the same incident or Claim Event. In this case, both Benefits will be paid i.e. You qualify for both an Illness Cover and Disability Cover payment.
Example
Example Details:
- You take out a policy with Life Cover, Illness Cover and Disability Cover.
- The Life Cover Sum Assured is R1 000 000.
- The Disability Cover Sum Assured is R1 000 000.
- The Illness Cover Sum Assured is R500 000.
Unfortunately, You get diagnosed with a stage IV cancer 2 (two) years later. In this scenario, both the Sum assureds relating to the Illness Cover and Disability Cover Benefit will be paid out to You (both qualify for a 100% payment in this scenario), that is, the Disability Cover Sum Assured of R1 000 000 and the Illness Cover Sum Assured of R500 000 will be paid out to You.

Content: Please note that if the 2 (two) Claims arise from the same incident or the same Claim Event and one of the Claims is for death, then the rules with respect to Waiting and Survival periods will apply, as detailed through this Policy.
14.4.2 Simultaneous Same Benefit Claims
Simultaneous Same Benefit claims are defined as the submission of Claims within 3 (three) months of each other, where the Claims were as a result of the same incident or Claim Event. This refers to Claims within the same Benefit category (i.e. 2 (two) Illness Cover Benefit Claims or 2 (two) Disability Cover Benefit Claims). Please note that when this occurs for lump sum disability Benefit Claims (Disability Cover and Accidental Disability Cover Claims), We will only pay 1 (one) Disability Benefit Claim since the maximum overall payout is 100% and therefore no pay out will be made for the second Claim.
Unrelated, Related and Progressive Illness Cover Benefit Claims
• In this scenario, we will pay the maximum of the 2 (two) Claims.
• If the first Claim is bigger than the second Claim, then no payment will be made to You.
If the second Claim is bigger than the first Claim, then the difference between the 2 (two) Claims will be paid out to You.
Example
You take out a Policy with R1 000 00 Illness Cover. Unfortunately, You are involved in a terrible car accident and suffer the loss of use of both arms, where You qualify for a 150% payment.

Content:  Unfortunately, You are involved in a terrible car accident and suffer the loss of use of both arms, where You qualify for a 150% payment. You get paid out R1 500 000.
A month later, some of the injuries result in You becoming a quadriplegic, which qualifies for a 200% payment. In this scenario, a payout or R500 00 (200% -150% = 50% x R1 000 000) is made. If the new ailment was at 100%, then no payout would have been made, since 150% is larger than 100%.
Please note that this section (section 14.4) relates only to lump sum Benefits. This means that this section applies to all Benefits, except the Income Protection Benefit and Standalone Temporary Income Protection Benefit.
If You or Your Beneficiaries (or other nominated person, such as the executor of Your estate) needs to report a Claim, please contact the Administrator at:

The Policyholder or the Claimant must let Us know about the Claim Event within 3 (three) months from the Claim Event Date, unless there are extenuating circumstances for the late notice thereof (these extenuating circumstances will be examined and judged on a case by case basis). All relevant claim documents must be completed and submitted within 3 (three) months of the Claim Event Date, unless there are extenuating circumstances for the late completion and submission thereof. Please note that the Insurer/Administrator will decide, at their sole discretion, what constitutes an ‘extenuating circumstance’ on a case by case basis. If no notification is made to Administrator or Insurer within this period, no payout will be considered.
A Claim will be paid out once both the Administrator and Insurer are satisfied. There is no specified timeframe for this, unless specifically mentioned in the section relating to the relevant Benefit.

If a Benefit under this Policy is an Unclaimed Benefit, We will take action to determine if the Principal Insured/Nominated Beneficiary is alive and/or aware of the Benefit payable to him/her under this Policy. Specifically, in the 3 (three) year period after the Unclaimed Benefit arises, We may:
• attempt to contact the Principal Insured/Nominated Beneficiary telephonically and electronically to advise them of the Unclaimed Benefit; or
• determine the last known contact information of the Principal Insured/Nominated Beneficiary by comparing internal and external databases, including the use of internet search engines and/or social media; or
• appoint an external tracing company to locate the Principal Insured/Nominated Beneficiary.
Before the end of the 3 (three) year period referred to above, We will confirm the Unclaimed Benefit and transfer the amount of the Unclaimed Benefit to an account in the name of the Insurer, and the Insurer will accept liability for the Unclaimed Benefit.

Content: 15. Premiums
The owner of the Life Policy must pay the Premium of the total amount stated in the Policy Schedule. Premiums are payable monthly in advance on or before the first day of each calendar month for the duration of the Policy.
The monthly Premium will be automatically be debited from Your selected payment method by Us on Your selected payment date (this also includes the Discount Activation Premium, if the No Cancel Benefit is selected on the Policy). If Your selected payment date falls on a weekend or recognised South African Public Holiday, Your Premium payment date may change, and We may debit Your selected payment method on a different date.
A Premium will be debited from Your selected payment method on Your Date of Commencement. That is, once You have concluded the onboarding process, a deduction from Your selected payment method will immediately be made. If Your Commencement Date is during a month, a pro-rated Premium will be deducted and this will be paid to Us. This deduction will occur on the day that the Policy was taken out.
We will only consider the Premium as paid when it is confirmed received by the Insurer. This is provided that the Premium is not reversed later. You will only have rights to ownership of the Policy when the first Premium is received. This means that the Insurer will only become liable to provide Policy Benefits, once the first Premium is received.

Content:  This means that the Insurer will only become liable to provide Policy Benefits, once the first Premium is received.
This Benefit gives You a Premium discount if You agree not to cancel or lapse Your Policy up until the next No Cancel End Date.
When is the No Cancel End Date?
If You select the No Cancel Option on Commencement Date (or Policy Anniversary), then the No Cancel End Date will be 12 (twelve) months from the time You select the option.
If You select the No Cancel Option after the Commencement Date (or anytime between Policy Anniversaries), then the No Cancel End Date will be the next Policy Anniversary which is at least 1 (one) calendar year after the date on which the No Cancel Option was first selected on Your Policy.
This option can be selected at the Commencement Date or at any point during Your Policy term.

The discount can be maintained for the entire duration of the Policy if You continue to select the No Cancel Discount option each year. If in any year, You do not make a decision around the No Cancel Option, You will be defaulted to the option that You selected in the previous year. You can remove the Benefit option at any point in time. In this circumstance, the No Cancel Discount percentage will no longer apply to Your Premium and this will take effect from the next No Cancel End Date.
The discount, applicable to Your Policy, can be found on Your Policy Schedule. This discount will apply to all risk Benefits on the Policy from the date that the Benefit option is selected. If the date when this Benefit is selected on the Policy differs to the date when it applies on the Policy, then the latter will be considered to be the date on which the Benefit was selected.
If You select the No Cancel Discount, You will be debited Your monthly Policy Premium as well as an additional Premium (called the Discount Activation Premium) in the month where the No Cancel Discount is first selected on Your Policy. The No Cancel Discount will apply until the No Cancel End Date.
What happens if I do/do not cancel my Policy before the No Cancel End Date?
If You cancel Your Policy before the No Cancel End Date, You will forego this Discount Activation Premium.

If You cancel Your Policy before the No Cancel End Date, You will forego this Discount Activation Premium.
If You do not cancel Your Policy before the No Cancel End Date, the Discount Activation Premium will be deducted off the Premium You pay in the Deduction Month (the month before the No Cancel End Date). Please note that the Discount Activation Premium will be used to pay for the partial or total Premium in the Deduction Month (subject to the maximum value of the Discount Activation Premium) and excludes any premium increases on the Policy between the date on which the option was selected and the No Cancel End Date, either from the Dynamic Financial Analysis or from any elective increases.
If, for any reason, Your Premium increases between the date on which the No Cancel Option was selected and the No Cancel End Date, We may also deduct an additional Premium equal to the size of the Premium change in order to cover the additional Discount Activation Premium required such that the discount would also apply to the Premium increase.
The following scenario may have the discount applied for less than the full 12 (twelve) month period:
• If Your Commencement Date is during a month, then the No Cancel Discount will apply from the Anniversary Start Date until the next Policy Anniversary Date.

Content: Example 2
Example Details
• You take out a OneSpark policy on 1 January 2020
• You do not decide to take the No Cancel Option at Commencement Date.
• The normal monthly Premium is R100.
• You pay R100 for 6 months and then, on the 1 June 2020, You decide to take out the No Cancel Discount.
• In this example, You qualify for a 15% discount.
• Your Premium goes down to R85.
• You are debited by R170 at this point in time, and the Discount Activation Premium is R85.
• On 1 January 2021, Your Premium would have increased from R100 to R110, in line with Your changing needs and the Dynamic Premium Adjustment.
• Benefit option start date = Month 6 (June 2020)
• Deduction Month = Month 24 (December 2021)
• No Cancel End Date = Month 25 (January 2022)
In this example, You do not cancel Your Policy, therefore the Premium You pay in the Deduction Month (the month before Your No Cancel End Date) will be the full Policy Premium at that time minus the Discount Activation Premium of R85.
You can keep the 15% discount until Your No Cancel End Date (Policy Anniversary at 1 January 2022). At that point in time, You can re-select the one year No Cancel Option and thus lock in the discount for another year. At this point, the Premium increases from R110 to R125. If You choose the No Cancel Discount Option at that point in time, then You will pay R106.

Should a Premium remain unpaid for a period longer than the grace period, a double Premium will be submitted for collection the following month. Should Premiums remain unpaid for a period equal to the grace period plus another full calendar month, the Policy will lapse automatically, and all Benefits on this Policy will cease. In this circumstance, the ShareBack Benefit (or any payments that are owed to You from the ShareBack Benefit) will also fall away. Any Claim lodged in a month where a Premium has not been paid will be considered and if approved, the outstanding Premium will be deducted from the Benefit Amount. Any Claim lodged in a month after the Policy has either lapsed or cancelled will be declined.

Each year, 31 (thirty-one) Days before Your Policy Anniversary date, the Administrator will inform You of how Your Policy will change after Your Anniversary Date. If for any reason You are unable to afford the premium increases, You should notify Us before the Anniversary Date. If You cannot afford the changes, for whatever reason, You may adjust Your policy by reducing or removing Benefits to allow for a lower Premium, to suit Your individual situation and what You can afford at that point in time. A new Policy Schedule will be sent to You confirming the changes made.
For each Benefit on the Policy, the monthly Premium (relating to that specific Benefit) may escalate annually by factor at Your Policy Anniversary, specified by the Administrator each year, which takes into account the Dynamic Benefit Adjustment for that specific Benefit, as well the age of the Life Insured at that point in time. This is termed the Dynamic Premium Adjustment. The Life Insured will receive a notification of such increase 31 (thirty-one) Days before the Policy Anniversary date.
In the event that the Premium(s) actually paid to the Insurer are incorrectly calculated so that they are in fact insufficient to pay for the Benefits as set out in the Schedule, then:
• The error may be corrected and subject to payment of the additional Premium, the full Sum Assured will be maintained.
• If no adjustment is effected within 31 (thirty-one) Days of the date of the original proposal as reflected in the Schedule, the Insurer’s liability shall be reduced by the ratio which the shortfall of the Premium bears to the total Premium due.

• If no adjustment is effected within 31 (thirty-one) Days of the date of the original proposal as reflected in the Schedule, the Insurer’s liability shall be reduced by the ratio which the shortfall of the Premium bears to the total Premium due.
Premiums are not guaranteed, will be reviewed annually by the Administrator and/or the Insurer and may be amended or changed, based on the following factors: past and future expected economic factors (for example, but not limited to, interest rates, tax and inflation), any past or expected future anti-selection or moral hazard exhibited by the Life Insured on the Policy, past and future expected lapse experience, past and future expected mortality and morbidity experience, expected future reinsurance, administrative and operational costs of the Administrator, any other expected future costs to be incurred by the Administrator, any regulatory and legislative changes impacting this Policy or any other factor impacting the Premium that the Administrator/Insurer deems material at the time.
Any changes to the Premium will be notified to the Policyholder 31 (thirty-one) Days prior to the change taking effect. Such notification will confirm the reason for the change to the Premium.

Content: 16. Reinstatements
If You cancel Your Policy or Your Policy lapses, and thereafter (within 2 (two) months only) decide to re-instate it at or below the original levels, the reinstatement will only be permitted on the receipt of all Your outstanding Premiums, together with the completion of Our Declaration of Health form or whatever underwriting requirements the Administrator or Insurer may deem necessary from time to time. Your cover will be reinstated to the original levels just before You cancelled Your Policy or just before Your Policy lapsed. However, all Waiting Periods (such as the 60 (sixty) month suicide Waiting Period) will start again from the reinstatement date.
No reinstatement will be allowed after 2 (two) months from originally cancelling Your Policy. In this scenario, You will be treated as a new business client with all new business rules, terms and conditions applying.
Please note that:
• You can cancel Your Policy and then subsequently reinstate it a maximum of 2 (two) times over the entire duration of Your Policy term. Thereafter, this Policy will be treated as a new policy, with all the rules, terms and conditions applicable for a new policy.
• Reinstatements will only be allowed if You pay any and all outstanding Premiums before the reinstatement occurs.

Should You wish to cancel Your Policy at any time after the initial Cooling-off Period, You must provide a cancellation instruction In Writing to the Administrator or Insurer. We will provide cover until the end of the same billing cycle in which a Premium has already been paid in which the cancellation instruction has been received. Please note that such cancellations, after the initial 31 (thirty-one) Day Cooling-off Period, will not attract a refund of any Premiums paid.
This Policy acquires no surrender, paid-up or loan values. There is no cumulative effect of Premiums paid and each monthly Premium is used to cover the risk for that specific month. Each month a Premium is required to be paid to renew the cover. Additionally, no cessions will be allowed.
There is no surrender value in respect of the ShareBack Benefit and nothing will be paid out when the Policyholder cancels their Policy.
Strict compliance by an Insured Life with all the provisions, conditions and terms of this Policy shall be a condition precedent to liability on the part of the Insurer hereunder.
The decision of the Insurer as to the meaning of or interpretation of the Policy shall be final and binding on the Policyholder and every person claiming to be entitled to a Benefit in terms of this Policy.

Content: Pre-malignancy and carcinoma-in-situ tumours except for carcinoma-in-situ of the breast treated by mastectomy are not covered under this Benefit.
A current internationally recognised staging system will be used to assess the Claim Event.
A report from the treating Specialist, including the histology and stage of the cancer, the relevant imaging reports and other tests must confirm the diagnosis.
Once a payment for a cancer listed under Severity A or Severity B cancer has been made, further cancer claims will only be considered for unrelated cancers. An unrelated cancer is a cancer that is not regarded as being of the same tissue and the same organ. The unrelated cancer will be considered as a new Life Changing Event.
Where stem cell or bone marrow transplants are performed as treatment for cancer, only one Severity A or B Claim will be paid. Only one bone marrow or stem cell transplant will be paid during the lifetime of the Policy.
If two cancers of two different tissue types are present and have manifested independently of each other then, subject to the limits of the Policy as well as the terms of the Policy payment rules, each cancer will be considered as a separate Life Changing Event. These two claims will be regarded as claims within the same body system.

21.3 APPENDIX 3
The Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is an internationally used scoring system that assesses the functional ability of a person including the physical, cognitive and interactive abilities. OneSpark uses the ADLs to assess functioning in the Illness Cover, Disability Cover and Income Protection Benefits when objective criteria of impairment are needed – for example when neurological and connective tissue diseases are assessed. Changes to the ADLs must be permanent, must have occurred after the Commencement Date of the Policy, and must be due to the condition, illness or event that is being claimed for.
OneSpark reserves the right to request an occupational therapist's or neuropsychologist's assessment of ADL functioning, using standardised assessment methods.
THERE ARE SIX CATEGORIES OF ADLS:
• Self-care
• Communication
• Physical Activity
• Sensory Function
• Hand Function
• Advanced Activities.
The terms 'no impairment', 'moderately impaired', 'severely impaired' and 'very severely impaired' are used in the Advanced Activities category. The terms 'independent', 'impaired', 'unable' are used in all the other categories. These terms are defined in the Activities of Daily Living Score Sheet below.
SELF-CARE
• If a person is unable to do one activity within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Self-care category of the ADL Score Sheet.

SELF-CARE
• If a person is unable to do one activity within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Self-care category of the ADL Score Sheet.
• If a person is impaired in doing two activities within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Self-care category of the ADL Score Sheet.
• If a person is unable to do one activity within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Communication category of the ADL Score Sheet.
• If a person is impaired in doing two activities within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Communication category of the ADL Score Sheet.
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
• If a person is unable to do three activities within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Physical Activity category of the ADL Score Sheet.

• If a person is impaired in doing two activities within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Sensory Function category of the ADL Score Sheet.
• If a person is unable to do one activity within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Hand Function category of the ADL Score Sheet.
• If a person is impaired in doing two activities within this category, it is scored as the inability to perform the Hand Function category of the ADL Score Sheet.
It is scored as the inability to perform the Advanced Activity category if:
• A person is moderately impaired in all four areas; or
• A person is severely impaired in two of the four areas; or
• A person is very severely impaired in one of the four areas.

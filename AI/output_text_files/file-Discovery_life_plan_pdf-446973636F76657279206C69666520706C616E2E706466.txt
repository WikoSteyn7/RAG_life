THE LIFE PLAN
THE LIFE PLAN HELPS YOU TO MAINTAIN YOUR LIFESTYLE IF YOU EXPERIENCE A LIFE-CHANGING EVENT
The Life Plan provides cover for life-changing events for the whole family. These events include death, severe illness and disability and are fully described in the rest of the Life Plan Guide. There are three types of Life Plans available that provide cover for personal assurance; the Classic Life Plan, the Essential Life Plan and the Purple Life Plan.
The Classic Life Plan provides broad, comprehensive and efficient long-term protection for you and your family. It allows for unlimited risk cover through multiple claims facilities and reinstatement benefits as well as financial benefits such as PayBacks and Cash Conversion benefits.
The Purple Life Plan is aimed at high net worth individuals. Your Life Fund needs to be above a certain level to qualify for this Life Plan. In addition to all the benefits from the Classic Life Plan it also provides additional bespoke local and global benefits together with an enhanced 24-hour service offering on Vitality Purple.
The Essential Life Plan provides cost-effective risk protection benefits to principal and spouse lives only, recognising the need for a narrower range of benefits in return for lower premiums.
Discovery’s Life Plan also rewards you for managing and improving your health through Vitality or Vitality Purple.

Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-7
Content: 
Discovery’s Life Plan also rewards you for managing and improving your health through Vitality or Vitality Purple. Please note that the mechanics of the Vitality and Vitality Purple programmes are the same. As a result, unless otherwise specified, your Vitality Purple status and Vitality Purple programme will simply be referred to as ‘Vitality status’ and ‘Vitality programme’ respectively throughout this guide. This is regardless of which Vitality programme is applicable to your policy.
See Appendix 9 for a more detailed overview of the difference between the Life Plans.
2.1 THE LIFE FUND IS THE FINANCIAL FOUNDATION OF YOUR LIFE PLAN
The Life Plan has, as its basis, a Life Fund which is the financial mechanism of the Life Plan. The Life Fund is used to fund benefit payments for the benefits you and your family have selected. It is yours to manage during your lifetime to ensure maximum cover of future long-term commitments.
2.2 YOUR LIFE FUND CAN GROW TO OFFER YOU INCREASED COVER
You may choose to have your Life Fund remain level or to have it grow at the benefit escalation rate.
The benefit escalation rate is a rate at which the Life Fund increases automatically on each policy anniversary. There are two typesof escalation rates:
• Consumer Price Index: Benefits increase annually at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as determined by Statistics South Africa. This rate will differ from year to year as CPI fluctuates.
Page Number: 3
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-8
Content:  This rate will differ from year to year as CPI fluctuates. Discovery Life, will use the CPI figure as released by Statistics South Africa three months before each policy anniversary.
• Fixed percentage: Benefits increase annually at a fixed percentage selected at inception of your policy. This rate remains constant from year to year.
2.3 BENEFITS ARE DEFINED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE LIFE FUND
Your policy reflects the benefits selected by you. These benefits are defined as a percentage of your Life Fund unless you have chosen the non-accelerated versions of these benefits. Multiplying the benefit percentage by the Life Fund at inception of the policy defines the initial monetary amount of cover for each benefit.
2.4 WHAT EFFECT DO BENEFIT PAYMENTS HAVE ON THE LIFE FUND, COVER INTEGRATOR AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATOR FUND?
The descriptions and references to Life Fund include reference to the Cover Integrator and the Financial Integrator Fund (if applicable), for the Classic Life Plan, the Purple Life Plan and the Essential Life Plan unless specifically excluded.
Benefit payments are defined as:
Any amount of money paid to you as a result of you claiming against your Life Fund for a life-changing event.
When you receive an accelerated benefit payment from your Life Fund, the value of your Life Fund is reduced by the amount of the benefit payment (taking into account any conversion rates in the case of AccessCover, AccessCover Plus and Estate Planning AccessCover if applicable).

Content: SECTION 2
MULTIPLE CLAIMS
Multiple claims arise when you qualify for payments from more than one benefit as a result of the same life-changing event. In this case, the highest benefit payment will be processed first and the Life Fund will reduce by this benefit payment amount.
Subsequent benefit payments related to the same event will be processed against the reduced Life Fund value after the first claim payment has been deducted. The same effective date will apply for the assessment of the benefit payment amount for these multiple claims. This effective date is the date on which the life-changing event occurs.
SIMULTANEOUS CLAIMS
Simultaneous claims are defined as the submission of claims for the principal life and spouse within three months of each other, where the claims were as a result of the same incident or life-changing event.
In the event of a simultaneous death claim being submitted for the principal life and spouse, the benefit payment will be equivalent to the amount of the Life Fund at the time of their deaths, plus an additional amount equivalent to the spouse’s life cover. The policy will terminate after these payments have been made.
Simultaneous claims may also arise for the principal life and spouse under the Severe Illness Benefit (Section 6) and the Capital Disability Benefit (Section 7). In this case, two benefit payments will be made. The second benefit payment amount will be determined based on the Life Fund value before the Fund has been reduced by the first benefit payment.

================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-10
Content:  In this case, two benefit payments will be made. The second benefit payment amount will be determined based on the Life Fund value before the Fund has been reduced by the first benefit payment. Should the sum of the two benefit payments exceed the Life Fund amount, the policy will be terminated after both benefit payments have been made.
2.5 WHAT EFFECT DO BENEFIT PAYMENTS HAVE ON PREMIUMS?
A feature of the Life Plan is that Severe Illness Benefits, Family Benefits and Disability Benefits do not fall away after a claim. Therefore, the premiums for your Life Plan remain unchanged after a claim. Premiums for each benefit will cease once the benefit expiry age for that particular benefit is reached. Should multiple lives be assured on the same Life Plan, a benefit payment for one assured life will result in the benefits for the other assured lives being reduced. In this case, the premiums for the benefits attributable to these other lives will be reduced proportionally to the reduction in benefit. Should a claim be made under AccessCover or AccessCover Plus, the premiums for the Life Cover Benefit will reduce proportionately.
2.6 CAN I PREVENT MYSELF FROM RUNNING OUT OF COVER?
Yes. This can be done in two ways:
2.6.1 TOPPING UP YOUR LIFE FUND – Should your Life Fund start to deplete due to benefit payments or if your circumstances change and you need additional cover, you can increase your Life Fund, subject to medical underwriting.
Page Number: 4
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-11
Content: 6.1 TOPPING UP YOUR LIFE FUND – Should your Life Fund start to deplete due to benefit payments or if your circumstances change and you need additional cover, you can increase your Life Fund, subject to medical underwriting. An additional premium will be payable for this increase in cover.
2.6.2 MAINTAINING A MINIMUM PROTECTED FUND – The Minimum Protected Fund option allows you to specify a minimum level for your Life Fund.
If you have selected this option, the balance in your Life Fund will never drop below your specified minimum balance – no matter how many benefit payments have been made or what the monetary value of these payments was, subject to the 14-day survival period as described below. On the death of the principal life, the Life Fund is fully depleted and the Minimum Protected Fund will no longer have an effect on the Life Fund.
A benefit payment reduces the Life Fund. Once the benefit payment has been made, the balance in the Life Fund will be compared to the value of the Minimum Protected Fund. This comparison will only be done once all benefit payments from the same life-changing event have been processed as described in paragraph 2.4. The Minimum Protected Fund may reinstate the Life Fund between Severe Illness Benefit claims which arise from the same life-changing event. This is discussed in Section 6.15. Should the balance in the Life Fund be below the Minimum Protected Fund, the Life Fund will be increased by an amount such that the Life Fund equals the Minimum Protected Fund.

Content:  This is discussed in Section 6.15. Should the balance in the Life Fund be below the Minimum Protected Fund, the Life Fund will be increased by an amount such that the Life Fund equals the Minimum Protected Fund. This restoration of part of the Life Fund will occur after a 14-day survival period from the occurrence of the life-changing event. Certain limits are applied to the Minimum Protected Fund reinstatements after multiple claims on the Essential Life Plan. Refer to Sections 6.15 and 7.6 for more information.
Should the life who experienced the life-changing event die within the 14-day survival period, the Life Fund will not be increased to the level of the Minimum Protected Fund. Please note that Life Cover is not reinstated by the Minimum Protected Fund following an AccessCover, AccessCover Plus or Estate Planning AccessCover claim.

Content: SECTION 2
EXAMPLE
Let’s assume you have a Life Fund of R1 000 000 and choose a Minimum Protected Fund of R500 000. Should a benefit payment of R800 000 be made, the Life Fund will be reduced to R200 000. If you survive 14 days, the Life Fund will be increased by R300 000 resulting in the Life Fund being the same as the Minimum Protected Fund.
You will be charged an additional premium for this facility. The extra premium will depend on the Minimum Protected Fund value you have chosen and also on the percentage of cover you have selected for your various benefits. Details will be shown in your Policy Schedule.
In the event of a disability or severe illness claim, the Minimum Protected Fund will only restore the Life Fund where the Capital Disability Benefit or the Severe Illness Benefit respectively has been selected to reduce the Life Fund and not in cases where the non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefit or non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefit was selected. In the event of a claim on AccessCover or AccessCover Plus Benefits, the Minimum Protected Fund will not reinstate the Life Cover benefit, but will reinstate ancillary benefits where applicable. If an ancillary claim is paid out after you have claimed on the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus or Estate Planning AccessCover benefits, the amount of life cover remaining may be less than the reinstated Minimum Protected Fund.
The Minimum Protected Fund, if selected, will also apply to your Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Fund.

Content: 
The Minimum Protected Fund, if selected, will also apply to your Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Fund. Please refer to your Policy Schedule to see if you have selected this option.
2.7 YOUR LIFE FUND CAN GROW AGAIN EVEN AFTER A BENEFIT PAYMENT HAS BEEN MADE
Your Life Fund will be reduced by the amount of the benefit payment. If you selected a Life Plan where the Life Fund increases annually at the benefit escalation rate, your Life Fund will continue to grow after the benefit payment by the benefit escalation rate.

EXAMPLE
Assume a Life Fund of R1 000 000 was chosen when you took out your policy and you selected a benefit escalation rate of CPI (eg 8% per year). At the end of the first year, your Life Fund will increase to R1 080 000 (ie R1 000 000 Plus 8%). This value will in turn increase by a further 8% after two years to R1 166 400 (ie R1 080 000 Plus 8%).
This pattern of increases will continue at each policy anniversary after the second year.
Note that although a CPI rate of 8% per year was used for each year in the above example, the actual annual CPI increase will fluctuate from year to year.

Note that although a CPI rate of 8% per year was used for each year in the above example, the actual annual CPI increase will fluctuate from year to year.

Benefit payments are based on the Life Fund plus annual benefit escalations. A benefit payment reduces the Life Fund by the benefit payment amount.
You may have selected a Minimum Protected Fund at inception of the contract. This is reflected at a level of R400 000 in the example above. This serves as a minimum below which the Life Fund cannot reduce, irrespective of the monetary amount and number of benefit payments made, subject to the rules defined in paragraph 2.4 and 2.6.2.
The Minimum Protected Fund increases annually on policy anniversary at the same benefit escalation rate applicable to the Life Fund. If you have selected the Minimum Protected Fund on your Cover Integrator and/or Financial Integrator Fund, it will increase annually on policy anniversary at the same benefit escalation rate applicable to these benefits.
2.9 DOLLAR SWAP OPTION (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC AND PURPLE LIFE PLANS)
As a Classic Life Plan or Purple Life Plan client, you will be eligible to swap a portion or all of your Rand cover (including Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator components) to a Dollar Life Plan at any point, free of underwriting, provided certain qualifying criteria (provided below) are met. After exercising the Dollar Swap Option, you may also receive the benefit of a locked in R/$ exchange rate for up to nine years.

Content:  After exercising the Dollar Swap Option, you may also receive the benefit of a locked in R/$ exchange rate for up to nine years. This feature is described in more detail in your Dollar Life Plan Guide at the time when the Dollar Swap Option is exercised.
QUALIFYING CRITERIA
• You are age 66 next birthday or younger at the time of exercising the Dollar Swap Option.
• The swap is free of underwriting only if the amount is less than or equal to $3.5m (using the last available forward R/$ exchange rate applicable at the time of the swap) after which you will need to go for underwriting.
• You have not claimed under the Severe Illness or Capital Disability benefits on any of your Life Plans.
• You must have an A1 risk rating on all the benefits on your Classic or Purple Life Plan.
• The Dollar Swap Option may only be exercised by principal or spouse lives insured on your Classic or Purple Life Plan.
• You may not exercise the swap within one year of the commencement date of your Purple Life Plan.
• You may exercise a Dollar Swap Option on multiple occasions. However, you will only receive the benefit of the locked in R/$ exchange rate on one Classic or one Purple Life Plan, subject to the maximum of $3.5m above.
• You are within the minimum and maximum limits on the Dollar Life Plan.
• All exclusions imposed on your benefits on your Classic or Purple Life Plan will apply to benefits on your Dollar Life Plan.

Content: SECTION 2
WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE DOLLAR SWAP OPTION ON YOUR CLASSIC OR PURPLE LIFE PLAN?
• If you decide to exercise the Dollar Swap Option, you will lose some or all of your Vitality Fund amount (depending on whether you convert some or all of your Life Fund to a Dollar Life Plan). We will however allow you to increase your Dollar Life Fund (at the time of the swap) by the Vitality Fund Sum Assured amount, which would result in a higher Dollar Life Fund than your Classic or Purple Life Fund at the time of the swap.
• Should the equivalent benefit(s) not exist on the Dollar Life Plan at the time of the swap, these benefit(s) may remain on the exsiting Classic or Purple Life Plan (subject to qualifying criteria and general servicing rules). After exercising the Dollar Swap Option, should the remaining benefits on your Purple Life Plan no longer meet the qualifying criteria for a Purple Life Plan, the remaining benefits will be moved to a Classic Life Plan.
• In some cases where the exact versions of the benefit are not available on the Dollar Life plan, we may provide options of other benefit versions to choose from at the time of the swap request. If you choose an equivalent but not identical benefit, we reserve the right to request additional underwriting at that point.
• Any accumulated PayBack fund on your existing Classic or Purple Life Plan policy may be reduced when exercising the Dollar Swap Option.

Content: 
• Any accumulated PayBack fund on your existing Classic or Purple Life Plan policy may be reduced when exercising the Dollar Swap Option.
• If you exercise the Dollar Swap Option on only a portion of your Purple Life Fund and the remaining portion does not qualify for a Purple Life Plan anymore, the remaining Purple Life Fund will automatically be converted to a Classic Life Fund.

Content: SECTION 3
WHEN YOUR COVER STARTS AND ENDS
WHAT LIFE-CHANGING EVENTS AM I COVERED FOR?
A life-changing event is defined as:
Death, or an illness or disability that is severe enough to affect your lifestyle or your ability to earn an income and lowers your standard of living. Policy terms and definitions apply – please refer to the specific sections as well as the definitions in the Appendices.
If all your premium payments are up-to-date, Discovery Life will compensate you for the occurrence of life-changing events covered by the benefits indicated on your Policy Schedule.
Benefit payments for benefits detailed in your Policy Schedule are limited to the total value of your Life Fund, Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Fund at the time when the benefit payment is made for a particular life-changing event, even if the life-changing event qualifies for benefit payments from multiple benefits. Any exception to this is clearly outlined in each benefit section of this guide and applies to benefits such as non-accelerated Severe Illness or Capital Disability benefits, the Income Continuation Benefit, Overhead Expense Benefit and LifeTime benefits.
3.1 CAN I INSURE MY SPOUSE, CHILDREN AND PARENTS ON THE SAME POLICY?
Yes. A single Life Fund is used to provide benefits for all members of your family unit.

Content: 
Yes. A single Life Fund is used to provide benefits for all members of your family unit. Instead of having to take out separate policies for each family member, Discovery Life can cover your spouse, children and parents under one policy. A 'spouse' is defined as a person who is the permanent life partner or spouse or civil union partner of a member in accordance with the Marriage Act, the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, or the Civil Union Act or the tenets of any religion.
A 'child' is defined as a biological child of the life assured or a child that has been legally adopted. Unless explicitly otherwise stated, a 'child' is considered as such where they are younger than 18.
3.2 WHAT BENEFITS DOES THE LIFE PLAN OFFER?
Your Life Plan offers you a number of valuable benefits, all supported by the Life Fund, Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Fund. They are:
3.2.1 LIFE COVER BENEFIT
3.2.2 SEVERE ILLNESS BENEFITS
• Available for the principal life and spouse
• Premium Waiver on the death of the principal life (only applicable if you have selected benefits for your spouse and/or children)
• The AccessCover benefit is automatically included on all qualifying life cover benefits, including the Life Fund, Cover Integrator Fund and Financial Integrator Fund (excluding the Buy-up Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Cash Conversion benefits). AccessCover Plus applies to the same qualifying life cover benefits as AccessCover for an additional premium
• The Vitality Fund benefit is available to the principal life on qualifying Purple Life Plans or Classic and Essential Life Plans with the Bank Integrator.

3.3 HOW LONG WILL YOUR POLICY BE VALID FOR?
Your policy commences on the inception date and remains in force until:
• You have given us one calendar month's notice to cancel your policy. No benefits are payable on or after the cancellation of your policy.
– Note that in some instances, we reserve the right to request written confirmation of your request to cancel your policy. – These instances include when your policy has multiple owners, is owned by a trust, is owned by a juristic person and when it is collaterally ceded (in which case we will also require a written confirmation of the removal of the cession).
• Your Life Fund, Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Fund is depleted due to a benefit payment.
• The policy is terminated with immediate effect due to fraud or dishonesty as described in Sections 15.2 and 15.3.

Content: 2 and 15.3.
• You have failed to pay your premiums for three months cumulatively (please refer to section 4.7.3).
Certain benefits may remain in force even after the Life Fund has been depleted due to a claim.
3.4 THE PRINCIPAL AND SPOUSE CONTINUATION OPTIONS
Should the Life Fund, Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator funds be depleted due to death, disability, or severe illness of the principal life, or due to an AccessCover or AccessCover Plus claim, the spouse and children may elect to continue their cover, without underwriting. The spouse will then become the principal life on the policy and the premiums payable by the spouse for all benefits will be the same as the premiums that would apply to a principal life for the same benefits.
Where the spouse had previously claimed or the spouse had previously had a premium loading as a result of a health condition, hazardous activity or occupation, the premiums on the continuation of the policy will allow for this. The spouse has 90 days to elect to continue the policy following the death of the principal life.
Where there is a Minimum Protected Fund included on the policy before the death of the principal life and the spouse has ancillary benefits, the Minimum Protected Fund will be included on the policy after the death of the principal life. The percentage of Minimum Protected Fund selected on the original policy will be applied to the new Life Fund.

Content:  The percentage of Minimum Protected Fund selected on the original policy will be applied to the new Life Fund. The new Life Fund will be equal to the benefit percentage applicable to the spouse's Life Cover Benefit multiplied by the Life Fund before the principal life's death.
Should the Life Fund be depleted due to the death, disability, severe illness of the spouse, or AccessCover or AccessCover Plus claim, the principal life and children may elect to continue with their cover, without underwriting.
Should the Life Fund be reduced due to the death of the spouse, or due to the spouse claiming on AccessCover or AccessCover Plus on a policy where there are no other benefits that accelerate the Life Fund, the principal life may choose to reinstate the Life Fund to its original level before the death of the spouse, without underwriting.

PREMIUMS
HOW DO MY DISCOVERY LIFE PREMIUMS INCREASE?
Premium and benefit increases depend on the Life Plan you selected on your application form. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the details applicable to your policy. Discovery Life will notify you annually of the amount of the increased premium and benefits.
Note: In establishing the various plans on offer, Discovery Life has calculated your monthly premium so that it should be sufficient to sustain your contract for your lifetime. Please see section 4.8 for an explanation of how Discovery Life may adjust your premium if certain events lead to this no longer being the case.
4.1 AUTOMATIC INCREASES
Discovery Life offers three funding plans from which to choose. These plans, known as the Standard, AcceleRater and FlexRater plans, allow you to select the rate at which your premiums increase each year. As shown in the table below, an annual premium increase may also provide for an annual benefit increase.
The premium and benefit increases will occur at each policy anniversary, with the first increase occurring 12 months after the start dateof the policy.
<table><tr><th>FUNDING PLAN</th><th>ANNUAL BENEFIT INCREASE</th><th>ANNUAL PREMIUM INCREASE</th></tr><tr><td rowSpan=3>STANDARD</td><td>No increase in Life Fund</td><td>No annual premium increase</td></tr><tr><td>Life Fund increases annually at 6.5%</td><td>Compulsory annual increase of between 7.

Notes:
Where Annual CPI increases are selected:
• The CPI component of annual CPI increases will never exceed 15% or be below 0%.
• Waived premiums cannot increase by more than 20% per year.
The premiums for your Income Continuation Benefit, Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit, Performance Bonus Protector and Buy-up Income Continuation Fund will increase annually according to the plan type selected on you policy as described above plus an additional 0.5% each year.
Premiums for the Global Health Protector and the Global Education Protector increase annually at a rate determined by Discovery Life, which may differ from the automatic annual premium increase rates relevant to other benefits on your Life Plan.
4.2 HOW DOES THE FLEXRATER PLAN DIFFER FROM THE STANDARD AND ACCELERATER PLANS?
The FlexRater plan has the same annual increases as the AcceleRater plan as reflected in paragraph 9.1. However, because the initial premiums for certain benefits are below those of the AcceleRater plan, an additional compulsory increase of 2.25% every year for the first 20 years is required for these benefits.

================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-30
Content: 25% every year for the first 20 years is required for these benefits. This means that 20 of these extra increases will apply. When adhoc benefit increases or additions are made, 20 extra increases will apply to the premium of each adhoc addition. After these 20 extra increases have been applied, the additional annual FlexRater Plan increase of 2.25% will fall away.
Note that this additional increase is not applicable to the premiums for the following benefits:
• Overhead Expenses Benefit
• Global Education Protector
• Global Health Protector
• Discovery Retirement Optimiser.

The Vitality Premium Leveller discount will apply additively to your Life Plan premium increase before integration and other adjustments and will continue to accumulate after the age when it begins to apply.
EXAMPLE
After your 65th birthday, assume that your Life Plan premium increase before the premium leveller, and excluding premium adjustments from Integration is 10% and your accumulated Vitality Premium Leveller discount is 3%. This means that the actual increase that will be applied at your Life Plan anniversary is 7% (10%-3%).

Content: SECTION 4
If you choose to remove Vitality while your Vitality Premium Leveller discount applies, you will maintain your accumulated discount percentage and will not accrue further discounts going forward.
Regardless of whether your spouse is insured on your policy, the Vitality Premium Leveller discount will apply when you turn age 66 next birthday (or 10 years after the policy commenced if this occurs later) , irrespective of your spouse’s age. In addition the annual Vitality Premium Leveller discount will only be based on your Vitality/Vitality Active status.
The Vitality Premium Leveller discount will apply to all your Life Plan premiums with the exception of:
• Vitality (including Vitality Active and Vitality Purple)
• Discovery Retirement Optimiser.
Once the Vitality Premium Leveller discount is applied, your total Life Plan premium will be subject to an overall minimum. This minimum is defined as 60% of the total Life Plan premium without the Vitality Premium Leveller discount. If this point is reached the annual Vitality Premium Leveller discount percentage will be set to 0%. Please note that this minimum is annually reviewable, taking into account emerging experience as well as consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment. The accumulated Vitality Premium Leveller discount in any year cannot exceed the Annual Contribution Increase that applies at that point.

Content:  The accumulated Vitality Premium Leveller discount in any year cannot exceed the Annual Contribution Increase that applies at that point.
EXAMPLE
Suppose your Life Plan premium is R1 000 and increases by 10% every year. Assume that your accumulated Vitality Premium Leveller discount is 5% and for simplicity remains constant with time. In Year 12 the premium reaches the specified minimum. At this point the Vitality Premium Leveller discount is set to 0% and the premium going forward will be 60% of the Life Plan premium without the Vitality Premium Leveller discount.

In addition to the 60% minimum applied to the Vitality Premium Leveller on its own, there is a further minimum applied when considering the combined impact of the Vitality Premium Leveller and the discounts from Integration and Vitality Rating. After allowing for all Integration benefits, your Vitality Rating Discount (discussed in the next section) and your Vitality Premium Leveller discount, your Integrated premium may be no less than 40% of the comparative non-Integrated premium. This includes the initial Integrator adjustments that you may have been eligible for under the Health Integrator (Section 10.1.1), the Vitality Integrator (Section 10.2.1), the Active Integrator (Section 10.3.1) and / or the Bank Integrator (Section 10.

4.4 VITALITY RATING
4.4.1 VITALITY RATING DISCOUNT
Vitality Rating rewards clients who demonstrate a low risk of future lifestyle related diseases, by providing them with an upfront premium reduction. This discount (referred to as the Vitality Rating discount) is applied multiplicatively to your Integrator premium reduction (see Section 10 for more information about the various Integrators available on your Life Plan). Only certain premiums qualify for Vitality Rating. Your premiums that qualify are detailed in your Policy Schedule.
You will qualify for Vitality Rating, subject to the following being met:
• The Health, Vitality or Active Integrator needs to be selected on your policy; and
• The qualifying benefit should be assigned an A1 risk rating. For example, if your Life Cover benefit is assigned an A1 risk rating, and your Severe Illness benefit is not, then only your Life Cover premium will receive the Vitality Rating discount (subject to the other criteria above being met).
We are able to assess your risk more accurately by using your results for the following health measures:
• Random Glucose (mmol/L) and HbA1c (%)
• Fasting/Random Cholesterol and LDL (mmol/L)
• Body Mass Index
• Blood Pressure (mm Hg).
Each health measure will be assigned a Vitality Rating class (Standard, Select or Lifetime Select), which will depend on its result.

Content: 
Each health measure will be assigned a Vitality Rating class (Standard, Select or Lifetime Select), which will depend on its result.
The specified healthiest range is Lifetime Select, the next specified healthiest range is Select and anything outside of Lifetime Select or Select will be defined as Standard. You will be assigned a single Vitality Rating, which depends on the Vitality Rating assigned to each health measure. This Vitality Rating will be determined as follows:
• Your Vitality Rating will be Lifetime Select if the Vitality Rating for each health measure is Lifetime Select
• Your Vitality Rating will be Select if your worst Vitality Rating class for any of the measures is Select
• Your Vitality Rating will be Standard if your worst Vitality Rating class for any of the measures is Standard.
Your Vitality Rating discount will depend on your Funding Plan and whether you have the Health, Vitality or Active Integrator. For Life Plans with the Health Integrator the Vitality Rating Discount will further depend on the life assured’s qualifying health plan on participating medical schemes administered by Discovery Health. The tables below illustrate how the Vitality Rating discount differs by the factors mentioned above. Note that Core Integrators will receive half the Vitality Rating discount reflected in the tables below.

If you are assigned Lifetime Select then your Vitality Rating discount will remain for your policy lifetime. If you are assigned either Select or Standard, your Vitality Rating discount will be reduced by a percentage at each of your first five policy anniversaries. If you are assigned Select, half of your Vitality Rating discount will be reduced by the end of your five-year period and if you are assigned Standard your Vitality Rating discount will be reduced completely by the end of the five-year period. The manner in which your Vitality Rating discount will be reduced at each of your first five policy anniversaries is detailed in your Policy Schedule. Your discount will be reduced by applying specified increases to the relevant premiums at each of your first five policy anniversaries. The size of the specified increases depend on your Vitality Rating discount.
EXAMPLE
Assume you are 40 years old, your policy is Health Integrated and you selected a Standard Funding Pattern (Annual Benefit Increase of CPI + 3%, where CPI is 5%). You qualified for a 15% Vitality Rating discount, and you are assigned a Standard Vitality Rating class. Your entire Vitality Rating discount will be reduced over the first five years of your policy, by applying specified increases to your policy at each of your first five policy anniversaries. At your first policy anniversary a 7.5% increase will be applied to premiums that received the Vitality Rating discount.

You have the opportunity to improve your Vitality Rating class (and therefore improve your Vitality Rating discount) if you were assigned a Select or Standard Vitality Rating class. You are able to submit new Vitality Health check results in order to improve your Vitality Rating class. If upon submission, your Vitality Rating class improves, your current Vitality Rating discount will be updated to correspond to that of the improved Vitality Rating class. Your improved Vitality Rating discount will only apply to the relevant premiums from this point onwards i.e. no retrospective adjustments will apply. Note that Discovery Life will only cover the cost of the Vitality Health Check at inception of your policy and when elective servicing events result in these tests being required. If you go for a Vitality Health Check at any other point, Discovery Life will only cover the cost of the Vitality Health Check required for a Vitality Rating review if the check is performed at the Discovery Life test centres (located at the Discovery Life stores). Discovery Life will not cover the Vitality Health Check if all a client’s cover has been issued as Lifetime Select.
If your premium increases through elective servicing events, the increase in your premium will receive the full Vitality Rating discount (provided the qualifying criteria are met). If your Vitality Rating class is Select or Standard this premium will receive its own Vitality Rating increases.

Content:  If your Vitality Rating class is Select or Standard this premium will receive its own Vitality Rating increases. It’s first Vitality Rating increase will occur at the first policy anniversary that falls at least six months from the servicing event. Note that your health check results will only be valid for two years from the date of your Vitality Health Check. If your premium increases through elective servicing events within this period, then the Vitality Rating class corresponding to these health check results will apply. If elective servicing events occur after the two year period, you will have to complete a new Vitality Health Check, whereby these results will be used to determine a new Vitality Rating class for this increased premium. Your premiums relating to cover before elective servicing events will not be affected, unless your Vitality Rating class has improved. In this case, the Vitality Rating discount applicable to these premiums will be updated to correspond to that of the improved Vitality Rating class.
4.4.2 VITALITY RATING LONGEVITY DISCOUNT
In addition to the Vitality Rating Discount, you may be eligible for a further premium reduction through the Vitality Rating Longevity discount. You can receive this discount on qualifying benefits on the policy anniversary after you turn age 66 next birthday or 10 years after Vitality Rating was added to the cover if this is later. The qualifying benefit must have had Vitality Rating for at least 10 years in order to be eligible for the discount.

Content:  The qualifying benefit must have had Vitality Rating for at least 10 years in order to be eligible for the discount. This means that the Vitality Rating Longevity discount may apply at different points in time, depending on when Vitality Rating was added to the cover or when the cover was added.

Similar to Vitality Rating, we are able to assess your risk more accurately by using your Vitality Health Check for 65+ results. The health check includes the same health measures as the Vitality Rating Discount, shown above. We may require additional tests if your results for any of these tests are out of range.
You will be eligible to complete a Vitality Health Check for 65+ at any time after you have turned age 66 next birthday. In order to qualify for the discount, you must notify Discovery Life of having done the Vitality Health Check for 65+.
The process of assigning you a Vitality Rating Longevity class (Standard, Select or Lifetime Select), will be the same as per Vitality Rating above, although this class may differ from your Vitality Rating class depending on the outcomes of your Vitality Health Check for 65+.
Your Vitality Rating Longevity discount will depend on your Integration type (Comprehensive or Core) and your allocated Vitality Rating Longevity class. The table below illustrates how the Vitality Rating Longevity discount differs by the factors mentioned above.

EXAMPLE
If your Life Plan qualifies for Comprehensive Health Integration and you are assigned the Lifetime Select Vitality Rating Longevity class based on the results of your Vitality Health Check for 65+, you will qualify for a Vitality Rat- ing Longevity discount of 10%. If your qualifying monthly premium at age 65 is R2 000, the effective premium after the discount will be R1 800 (R2000 x [1-10%]).
You have the opportunity to improve your Vitality Rating Longevity class (and therefore improve your Vitality Rating Longevity discount) if you were assigned a Select or Standard Vitality Rating class. You are able to submit new Vitality Health Check for 65+ results within two years of you submitting your first set of Vitality Health Check for 65+ results in order to improve your Vitality Rating Longevity class.

Content:  You are able to submit new Vitality Health Check for 65+ results within two years of you submitting your first set of Vitality Health Check for 65+ results in order to improve your Vitality Rating Longevity class. If upon submission, your Vitality Rating Longevity class improves, your current Vitality Rating Longevity discount will be updated to correspond to that of the improved Vitality Rating Longevity class. Your improved Vitality Rating Longevity discount will only apply to the relevant premiums from this point onwards i.e. no retrospective adjustments will apply. Discovery Life will only cover the cost of the Vitality Health Check for 65+ required for a Vitality Rating Longevity review if the check is performed at the Discovery Life test centres (located at the Discovery Life stores).
The Vitality Rating Longevity discount is applied differently to the Vitality Rating discount in that the Vitality Rating Longev- ity class determines the initial discount that is applied to qualifying premiums. This discount then applies for the remain- ing duration of the policy. All other rules including the eligibility criteria will be as per the Vitality Rating Discount.
VITALITY RATING LONGEVITY DISCOUNT EXCLUSIONS
If you claim under the following benefits on any of your Life Plans, you will not qualify for the discount:
• Severe Illness Benefit: Severities A to D for all conditions
• Severe Illness Benefit: Severities E to G for Cancer and Heart and Artery conditions
• Capital Disability: Categories A to D
• Income Continuation Benefit: Categories A and D
• Income Continuation Benefit: Claims longer than 6 months

4.5 WHAT COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR RECALCULATION OF YOUR PREMIUM?
You can add new benefits to the Life Plan at any time. Additional benefits will result in a higher premium. These additions will be subject to underwriting.
When any of the factors influencing your premium change, your premium could increase. For example, if you or your spouse are the assured lives on the policy and are paying non-smokers’ premiums, it’s essential that you notify us immediately should either of you ever take up smoking or use any other form of tobacco. If you or any of the lives insured under this policy undertake hazardous pursuits, such as extreme sport or dangerous hobbies on a regular basis, eg motocross, skydiving, underwater diving, rock climbing, private aviation or if your occupation now entails more travel or manual duties including travel outside the borders of South Africa. In addition, if you have indulged in or consumed narcotics (that were not prescribed by a medical practitioner) it is essential that you notify us. Discovery Life may then adjust, review and amend your premiums accordingly. If Discovery Life is not notified within a reasonable time, some or all of your benefits may be adjusted or removed.

Content: SECTION 4
The Paid-up option may not be added to a policy where the 200% Buy-Up Cash Conversion benefit is active. You will have to cancel your 200% Buy-up Cash Conversion benefit in order to add the Paid-up option. Further you will not be able to have the Paid-up option, the Buy-up Income Continuation Fund (see Section 7.27) and the 50% or 100% Buy-up Cash Conversion benefit on your policy at the same time.
Each qualifying risk benefit added (or electively increased) on your policy after the policy start date will have an individually calculated Paid-up maturity date for that benefit amount. This means that the premiums for different benefits or benefit amounts may become Paid-up at different times.
EXAMPLE
You take out a Standard Plan at age 40 with life cover only, and you select the Paid-up benefit. You add the Severe Illness Benefit (whole of life expiry) at age 50. At age 65 your life cover premium will cease, however, your Severe Illness Benefit premium will continue. At age 70 (after the minimum 20 year term), the remaining premium will cease. Similarly, if you were to increase your life cover at age 60, the portion of your life cover premium for this additional cover amount will only cease at age 80.
At the end of the month in which you turn age 65 your qualifying risk benefits will cease increasing annually by the benefit escalation rate. Your Integrated Cover Adjustments on your Cover Integrator Fund and Financial Integrator Fund (if applicable) will also cease at age 65.

Content:  Your Integrated Cover Adjustments on your Cover Integrator Fund and Financial Integrator Fund (if applicable) will also cease at age 65.
In the case of your death before the Paid-up maturity date, your beneficiaries or estate will receive a refund of 100% of your Paid-up premiums paid (without interest). As the different premiums may become paid up at different times, this return of premiums will only apply to the portions that haven’t reached Paid-up maturity yet at the time of death.
If you have selected the Premium Waiver on death benefit (see Section 5.4) on your policy, this benefit will automatically terminate once you have reached the latest Paid-up maturity age on your policy.
EXAMPLE
You take out a Standard Plan at age 43 with life cover for you and life cover for your spouse (also aged 43), and include the Premium Waiver on death benefit. At age 47, you increase your and your spouse’s life cover. Part of your premiums will therefore become paid-up at age 65 and part will become paid-up at age 67. Should you die at age 64, the Premium Waiver on death benefit will waive all of your spouse’s life cover premiums until age 67 (after which point all premiums are paid up in any case).
Please note that the premium guarantees described in Section 4.8 do not apply to this option and the premium for this option may be annually reviewable in light of a significant difference between current experience and the assumptions used when pricing, and with due consideration to the general economic and regulatory environment.

4.6.2 LOCK-IN OPTION
This option is available on the AcceleRater plan only and must be selected from inception of your policy. Should this option be selected, automatic annual premium and benefit increases will cease at the point in time selected by you on your policy. This may be after 20 years or at the end of the month in which you turn 65.
The Health Integrator, the Vitality Integrator, the Active Integrator and the Bank Integrator annual premium adjustments (if applicable) will continue to be applied to any premium payable after reaching the duration or age applicable to the Lock-in option. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the adjustments applicable to your Life Fund.
Please note that the Lock-in option will not apply to any cover added through Cover and Financial Integrators after the end of the month in which you turn 56.
The benefit does not apply to Vitality and Vitality Active premiums or to contributions to the Discovery Retirement Optimiser.
Please note that the premium guarantees described in Section 4.

4.7 TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO PREMIUM PAYMENTS
4.7.1 WHO IS RESPONSIBLE TO PAY THE PREMIUMS?
The owner of the Life Plan must pay the premium of the total amount stated in the Policy Schedule, as amended from time to time. Premiums are payable monthly in advance each calendar month for the duration of the policy.

Page Number: 17
================================================================================

Content: SECTION 4
4.7.2 WHAT ASPECTS DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM?
The following factors all influence the level of premiums charged for the various benefits:
• Age, gender and marital status
• Total gross monthly income
• Health condition and medical history
• Previous and current assurance records
• Claim experience on your health plan, if you are a member of a participating health plan on a medical scheme administered
by Discovery Health
• Any other information that comes to the notice of Discovery Life
• Smoking and lifestyle habits
• Occupation
• Participation in dangerous activities
• Credit rating as per the National Credit Bureau.
Discovery Life may take some or all of these factors into account in determining your premium.
4.7.3 WHAT HAPPENS IF MY PREMIUMS ARE NOT PAID BY THE DUE DATE?
Discovery Life’s normal practice is to notify you in writing of the non-payment of a premium. If a premium is not paid on time, Discovery Life allows you a 30-day grace period from when the premium was due to settle your arrear payment. Should an insured event occur during this period, Discovery Life will consider a claim (subject to the terms of the policy) but will deduct any arrear premium due from the claim amount.
Should a second premium not be received (in other words you have failed to pay two premiums) your policy is suspended and no benefit under the policy would be payable should an insured event occur while the policy is two payments in arrears.
Should a third premium not be received (you have failed to pay three premiums), your policy will automatically lapse and your policy will be cancelled from the date at which the premiums were outstanding, whether or not you received a notification of your failure to pay.

================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-63
Content: 
Should a third premium not be received (you have failed to pay three premiums), your policy will automatically lapse and your policy will be cancelled from the date at which the premiums were outstanding, whether or not you received a notification of your failure to pay. In this case no benefit is payable if the insured event occurred during the period from the date that you failed to pay your first premium.
If the policy is suspended (in other words you have failed to pay two premiums) or lapsed (you have failed to pay three premiums), you may apply to Discovery Life to continue the cover that was provided by your suspended or lapsed Life Plan (as applicable) by the tender of payment of the outstanding premiums together with the completion of whatever underwriting requirements Discovery Life may deem necessary from time to time.
4.7.4 HOW DO I PAY MY PREMIUM?
Discovery Life will only collect your premiums via a debit order lodged on your bank account. Cash premiums will not be allowed.
4.7.5 WHAT IF I CANNOT AFFORD MY INCREASED PREMIUM ON POLICY ANNIVERSARY?
Each year, 31 days before your policy anniversary date, Discovery Life will forward a letter and Policy Schedule to you, detailing the changes to be effected to the policy. The automatic premium increases applied to your policy are compulsory and if for any reason you are unable to afford the automatic premium increases you should notify us before the next anniversary date.

================================================================================

Content:  The automatic premium increases applied to your policy are compulsory and if for any reason you are unable to afford the automatic premium increases you should notify us before the next anniversary date. Should the automatic premium increase be cancelled or lowered in order to suit what you can afford, the cover amount of the benefit will be lowered to allow for this change. A new Policy Schedule will be sent to you confirming the changes made.
Depending on the Life Plan selected, adjustments may be made to your policy to suit what you can afford, and a new Policy Schedule will be forwarded to you confirming the changes made.
4.7.6 CAN I RECEIVE A PREMIUM REFUND IF I CANCEL MY POLICY?
Should you voluntarily choose to cancel your Discovery Life Plan you will not receive a return of any premiums paid throughout the duration of the Life Plan.
4.8 CAN DISCOVERY LIFE CHANGE MY PREMIUM AND BENEFITS?
In calculating the premiums, Discovery Life has tried to ensure that your policy will not require additional premium adjustments for its duration. We therefore guarantee that premiums will not be increased for the first 10 years, except for any contractual premium increases. In addition, Discovery Life guarantees that if any premium increases are required at the end of the first 10 years and any 10-year period thereafter, these increases will not exceed 25% of your premiums being paid at that time.

Content: SECTION 4
Please note that these guarantees (including the additional certainty for engaging in Vitality as described below) do not apply to the Child Protector, Global Health Protector, Global Treatment Benefit, Global Education Protector, Paid-up Option or Lock-in Option, Estate Planning Benefit, Medtech Booster or Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund in the first 10-year period, nor any time thereafter.
Additional certainty by engaging with Vitality
As a member of Vitality, you have the potential to provide additional certainty to your Life Plan. At the end of each 10-year period, Discovery Life will determine the number of years you have been at each Vitality status level over the previous 10-year period, and will use this to ensure that the maximum potential increase of 25% at the end of each 10-year period is reduced in line with your health management. Please note that this percentage reduction does not apply to the Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums for the Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator benefits.
The percentage reduction for each year that you are on a particular Vitality status is as follows:
<table><tr><th>VITALITY STATUS</th><th>PERCENTAGE REDUCTION</th></tr><tr><td>BLUE</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>BRONZE</td><td>0.5%</td></tr><tr><td>SILVER</td><td>1.5%</td></tr><tr><td>GOLD</td><td>2.

Content: 5%</td></tr><tr><td>SILVER</td><td>1.5%</td></tr><tr><td>GOLD</td><td>2.5%</td></tr><tr><td>DIAMOND</td><td>2.5%</td></tr></table>
For example, at the end of 10 years, assuming you were on Blue status for two years, Bronze status for three years, Silver status for three years and Gold status for two years, the maximum potential premium increase is as follows:
25% - (2 x 0%) - (3 x 0.5%) - (3 x 1.5%) - (2 x 2.5%) = 14%
If your premiums on your Life Plan are being waived at the time of any potential premium increase (as a result of a claim on the Premium Waiver benefits on death, disability or severe illness) these increases will be fully covered by the waiver benefits. Where a client has a health loading due to the fact that they are HIV+, the guarantee period is just one year. The additional guarantee that can be earned through Vitality will not apply.

5.2 SPOUSE’S LIFE COVER BENEFIT
On the death of the spouse, a benefit payment equal to the amount of the spouse’s Life Cover Benefit will be made to the owner of the policy. The amount of this benefit payment is calculated using the same formula as in paragraph 4.1.1, but is multiplied by the benefit percentage applicable to the spouse's Life Cover Benefit at the time of claim. This benefit payment will reduce the Life Fund.
Please note that the Spouse Life Cover Benefit does not receive the Vitality Fund benefit or the Legacy Fund benefit on Purple Life Plans or Classic and Essential Life Plans with the Bank Integrator.
5.3 ADVANCES ON LIFE COVER CLAIMS
In an effort to support your nominated beneficiaries with funeral arrangements, your Life Cover (and spouse's Life Cover) benefit automatically includes an upfront benefit. With this benefit, a nominal amount will be paid within 48 hours of submitting a valid death certificate. The upfront amount will reduce the Life Cover claim payment. Please refer to your policy quotation for details on the size of this nominal amount.
In order to qualify for the upfront benefit, your Life Plan must have been in force for at least two years and the cause of death must not be unnatural. Note that this advance is subject to the claim being approved by Discovery Life to ensure all requirements are met.

Content:  Note that this advance is subject to the claim being approved by Discovery Life to ensure all requirements are met.
Should the claim be deemed invalid following our assessment criteria Discovery reserves the right to claim the payment back.
5.4 THE PREMIUM WAIVER ON DEATH ASSISTS YOUR FAMILY IN A TIME OF NEED
This benefit protects your family from financial distress in the event of the death of the principal life. If you have selected this benefit and the principal life dies, Discovery Life will pay the premiums for all benefits that were related to the spouse and children under the contract. A Life Fund will be established at a level sufficient to sustain the remaining benefits that were covered by the policy before the principal life’s death. The premiums for Vitality will be waived if your policy is Health or Vitality Integrated. The premium for Vitality Active will also be waived if your policy is Active Integrated. The premiums for Vitality drive and Vitality Money will not be waived. The Childbirth Benefit will fall away unless the spouse is pregnant, in which case the benefit will terminate after childbirth.

Content: SECTION 5
If no claim has been paid under the Premium Waiver, the benefit will terminate at the end of the month in which you turn 75. If the Premium Waiver is active due to a claim, the payments made from the Premium Waiver will cease at the end of the month in which the principal life would have turned 75. Discovery will no longer charge you a premium for the benefit if your premiums are being waived. Premiums will not be waived where the death of the principal life occurred as a result of suicide within two years of the policy commencement date or policy reinstatement date.
Assuming a plan was selected with the premium escalating at one of the premium escalation rates, the Premium Waiver covers these increases to a maximum of 20% per year. Discovery Life’s premium guarantee as detailed in Section 4.8 will be fully covered by this waiver benefit.
Please note that the Global Education Protector benefit will not be included in the Death Premium Waiver benefit (as no further premiums are payable on this benefit following the death of the first spouse).
5.5 THE TERMINAL ILLNESS BENEFIT GIVES YOU COVER FOR YOUR LIFE, NOT YOUR DEATH
This benefit is designed to help a life assured who need Funds – for whatever reason – before death, once they have been diagnosed with a terminal illness. This benefit is applicable to any assured life that has the Life Cover Benefit and is included at no additional cost.
Page Number: 21
================================================================================

Content:  This benefit is applicable to any assured life that has the Life Cover Benefit and is included at no additional cost.
This benefit pays the full value of the Life Fund if a life assured has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and is deemed by the medical panel of Discovery Life in their sole discretion to have a survival period of 12 months or less.
On the Estate Planning Benefit, in the event of the surviving spouse suffering a terminal illness after the first spouse has passed away, the payout from the Estate Planning component will be accelerated to the date of the Terminal Illness diagnosis.
The Funds available for a full payment only from the Life Fund will be the equivalent of the balance of the Life Fund (including any applicable Financial Integrator, Cover Integrator, Vitality Fund amounts and Legacy Fund amounts) at the time of claim.
There will be no further benefit on death should the total Life Fund be claimed for the Terminal Illness Benefit.

Content:  You may convert a percentage of your life cover into cash at a specified conversion rate as defined by Discovery Life. For every R1 of life cover that you choose to convert, you will receive a certain value (in cents) depending on the condition. These conversion rates may be amended by Discovery Life from time to time in their sole discretion.
Medical AccessCover is automatically included on your policy at no extra charge if you meet certain underwriting criteria and gives you the option to convert a percentage of your life cover into cash for a range of medical definitions. In order to qualify you cannot have any premium loading on your Life Cover benefit due to a health condition.
You may also purchase AccessCover Plus which gives you early access to a percentage of your life cover for a range of additional events:
• Longevity AccessCover gives you the option to convert a percentage of your life cover into cash on reaching certain age milestones in your life. Up to 50% of your total qualifying life cover can be converted at each of the specified ages.

Content: 
• You may not access any cover added by the Future Fund benefit if you have previously claimed on the AccessCover or AccessCover Plus benefits.
• For an AccessCover or AccessCover Plus claim to be considered, the claim must be submitted and received by Discovery Life within three months of the event that resulted in the claim. The AccessCover or AccessCover Plus event date is defined as the date of the first diagnosis which would have met the criteria under the AccessCover or AccessCover Plus definition in Appendix 6. For example, if the definition requires two measurements, the AccessCover or AccessCover Plus event date is when the result of the second measurement is made known to the client, provided that both measurements meet the qualifying criteria.
• Any applications for an increase in the Life Fund after the end of the month in which the applicant turns 65 will not contribute towards the Longevity AccessCover payout.
• If you die or are diagnosed with a terminal illness within three months of converting a percentage of your life cover on any of the Medical AccessCover criteria, the death payout will be increased to the amount that would have been received had that cover been converted at a conversion rate of R1 to the rand.
• If the Life Fund is depleted due to a claim on AccessCover or AccessCover Plus, the spouse (if applicable) will have a guaranteed insurability option, as defined in Section 3.

Content: SECTION 5
EXAMPLE
You have R1 000 000 of life cover without any medical loadings on your premium of which R500 000 can be converted under the AccessCover Plus benefit according to your Policy Schedule. Upon being diagnosed with a Category C Medical AccessCover event you choose to convert R400 000 of your life cover into cash (the converted life cover). Your life cover will reduce by R400 000 (the converted life cover) and you will receive a payment of R400 000 x 0.75 = R300 000. Your life cover premium will also reduce proportionately.
Reductions in life cover due to a claim on AccessCover or AccessCover Plus will reduce the total Life Fund. All ancillary benefits which are expressed as percentages of the total Life Fund may also reduce. However, if you have the Minimum Protected Fund, these ancillaries may be reinstated. Your life cover premiums will reduce to reflect the reduction in life cover amounts. The premiums for the other ancillary benefits will however remain unchanged, even if their cover amounts may have been reduced.
AccessCover and AccessCover Plus payouts will not reduce the PayBack calculated (if applicable) in any five-year cycle.
Premiums for the AccessCover Plus benefit will cease at the end of the month you turn 90, unless the full available AccessCover Plus amount has been accessed at an earlier age.
If the AccessCover or AccessCover Plus condition also results in claim payment(s) under the Severe Illness and/or Capital Disability and/or Spouse Life Cover Benefits, these claims will be processed first, together with any applicable Minimum Protected Fund reinstatements.

Content: 
If the AccessCover or AccessCover Plus condition also results in claim payment(s) under the Severe Illness and/or Capital Disability and/or Spouse Life Cover Benefits, these claims will be processed first, together with any applicable Minimum Protected Fund reinstatements. The AccessCover or AccessCover Plus converted life cover and payout will be calculated on the remaining life cover after any applicable Minimum Protected Fund reinstatements.
EXAMPLE
You have R1 000 000 of life cover without any medical loadings on your premiums with 50% Severe Illness Benefit cover and no Minimum Protected Fund. The full life cover amount can be converted through the AccessCover benefit according to your Policy Schedule, because you have sufficient qualifying ancillaries. If you are diagnosed with stage IV malignant melanoma, the Severity A Severe Illness Benefit payment of R500 000 will be made. The life cover will reduce to R500 000 and the remaining Severe Illness Benefit will be R250 000. Stage IV malignant melanoma is a Category C under the Medical AccessCover definitions. If you choose to convert R250 000 of this remaining life cover through the AccessCover benefit, your life cover will reduce to R250 000 and you will receive a payment of R250 000 x 0.6 = R150 000. Your life cover premium will reduce proportionately.

Content: 6 = R150 000. Your life cover premium will reduce proportionately. Because your life cover has reduced by 50% as a result of you exercising AccessCover, your Severe Illness cover, which is half of your life cover, will also reduce by 50%. You will therefore have R125 000 Severe Illness Benefit remaining.
If you have claimed on AccessCover or AccessCover Plus, the Minimum Protected Fund will not reinstate the life cover that you have accessed. It will, however, reinstate all applicable ancillaries.
EXAMPLE
You have R1 000 000 of life cover (the full amount which can be converted through the AccessCover benefit as per your Policy Schedule, because you have sufficient qualifying ancillaries). In addition, you have 50% Severe Illness Benefit Cover and 100% Minimum Protected Fund. If you are diagnosed with stage IV Malignant Melanoma, the Severity A Severe Illness Benefit payment of R500 000 will be made, with the life cover being reinstated to R1 000 000 (and the Severe Illness Benefit cover to R500 000) after 14 days. If you choose to convert 50% of this life cover through the AccessCover benefit, your life cover will reduce to R500 000 and you will receive a payment equal to R500 000 x 0.6 = R300 000. Your life cover premium will reduce proportionately. However, your Severe Illness Benefit cover will be reinstated back to R500 000 (with the Severe Illness Benefit’s premium remaining unchanged).

Content:  However, your Severe Illness Benefit cover will be reinstated back to R500 000 (with the Severe Illness Benefit’s premium remaining unchanged). The premium for your Minimum Protected Fund benefit will also remain unchanged in this case.
AccessCover and AccessCover Plus payments will have no effect on the Life Plan Optimiser of the Discovery Retirement Optimiser or the Buy-up Cash Conversion benefits on the Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator. In the event that an AccessCover claim reduces the Life Fund to R0 where there is Buy-up Cash Conversion on the policy, we will return the Buy-up Cash conversion premiums paid to date adjusted by the AccessCover conversion rate that was applied to the Life Fund.
If an ancillary claim is paid out after you have claimed on the AccessCover or AccessCover Plus benefits, the amount of life cover remaining may be less than the reinstated Minimum Protected Fund.

Both of these benefits pay out a lump sum if your condition fulfils the criteria for one of the defined severe illnesses listed in Appendices 1 and 2.

If you have chosen the accelerated Severe Illness Benefit, claims from the Severe Illness Benefit will reduce your Life Fund.

6.4 FAMILY ILLNESS BENEFITS

Content: 
FEMALE BENEFIT
The Female Severe Illness Benefit is a whole of life accelerated benefit which covers females for severe illness conditions which may pose a risk to them such as cancers, complications associated with pregnancy and osteoporosis.
This benefit provides cover for Severities A to G, as specified in Section 16 of Appendix 1.
FAMILY TRAUMA BENEFIT
This benefit covers accidental injuries and certain medical emergencies due to trauma for severities A to G as specified in Section 15 in Appendix 1; including burns, coma due to trauma requiring resuscitation or ICU stay. The claimant must be treated by a specialist in a recognised trauma or intensive care unit. For claims due to ICU admission, the ICU must be a recognised ICU unit as defined by the Critical Care Society of South Africa. A 10% additional benefit will be payable for any reconstructive surgery needed as a result of major trauma.
The family is defined to include the principal life, spouse and children up to age 18, irrespective of whether other benefits were selected for the spouse and children on the policy.
This is an accelerated benefit which covers each family member involved in a traumatic event. If more than one member of your family is involved in a traumatic event and a simultaneous claim is submitted, the proceeds will be paid on an accelerated basis.
For example, if the Family Trauma Benefit has been selected at 30% of a Life Fund of R1 000 000 and two family members submit a 100% claim, the benefit payments are calculated as follows:
Claim 1: 30% of R1 000 000 = R300 000
Balance of Life Fund after claim 1 = R700 000
Claim 2: 30% of R700 000 = R210 000
Balance of Life Fund after claim 2 = R490 000
A unique feature of your policy is cover for trauma resulting from participation in a hazardous activity.

Content: 
For example, if the Family Trauma Benefit has been selected at 30% of a Life Fund of R1 000 000 and two family members submit a 100% claim, the benefit payments are calculated as follows:
Claim 1: 30% of R1 000 000 = R300 000
Balance of Life Fund after claim 1 = R700 000
Claim 2: 30% of R700 000 = R210 000
Balance of Life Fund after claim 2 = R490 000
A unique feature of your policy is cover for trauma resulting from participation in a hazardous activity. Discovery Life provides you with cover as long as you notify us of your regular participation in the hazardous activity upfront. This enables us to adjust your premiums to accommodate these activities.
CHILDBIRTH BENEFIT
The Childbirth Benefit is an accelerated benefit which will help relieve some of the financial burden associated with a specified condition, for Severities A to G, as defined in Section 17 in Appendix 1.
In addition, as per the definitions outlined in Appendix 1, you may receive a lump sum benefit payment or for certain diseases, monthly payments from your Life Fund. Your monthly payment will be 1% of the benefit amount, and will be increased by 5% every year on the anniversary of when the benefit commenced.
The Childbirth Benefit does not cover surrogate motherhood.

Content: SECTION 6
The Childbirth Benefit terminates at the end of the month in which the insured female life turns 40. Thereafter you will no longer be required to pay premiums for this benefit. Should you reduce or remove the Childbirth Benefit from your policy, you will not be able to increase it or add it to the policy at a later time.
The following benefits are automatically included under Discovery Life’s Standard and LifeTime Severe Illness Benefits and no separate premium is charged for them.
AUTOMATIC COVER FOR CHILDREN (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC AND PURPLE LIFE PLANS)
Should the principal or spouse have purchased cover for either the Standard or LifeTime Severe Illness Benefits, an amount of Severe Illness cover is automatically included for their children. The children will be covered for all conditions listed under Sections 1 to 14 in Appendix 1. If you would like to purchase an additional amount covering your children, you may select the Child Protector Benefit as described above.
The automatic cover for each child in the family is provided without medical underwriting, but all claims which arise directly or indirectly from any physical defects, illnesses, bodily injuries or diseases, that your child suffered from, or has received treatment or advice for or that you or your child were aware of, before the commencement of the policy, are excluded.
This cover expires at the end of the month in which the child turns 18.

================================================================================

Content: 
This cover expires at the end of the month in which the child turns 18.
To qualify for a benefit payment the child must be the biological child of the life assured or must have been legally adopted prior to the life changing event.
The benefit payment for any child is 10% of the parents’ aggregate sum assured across all policies for the Severe Illness Benefit multiplied by the relevant Severe Illness Benefit percentage, per claim event. These claims have no impact on the Life Fund. This payout will be made provided that it is lower than the specified maximum amount for automatic cover for children. The maximum amount payable per child, will apply across all policies with Discovery Life where either parent is insured under the Severe Illness Benefit. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for this maximum amount. Discovery Life reserves the right to review this maximum each year. Additionally, multiple claims are allowed under this benefit – however only up to this maximum amount.
EXAMPLE
A principal and a spouse purchase a Life Fund of R1 000 000. The principal has 60% Severe Illness Benefit (R600 000) and the spouse has 50% Severe Illness Benefit (R500 000). The specified maximum is R135 000.
Their child undergoes a craniotomy and qualifies for a Severity C (50%) claim.
The payout is calculated as follows: 10% of the Principal Severe Illness benefit x Severity of the claim = 10% x R600 000 x 50% = R30 000
10% of the Spouse Severe Illness Benefit x Severity of the claim = 10% x R500 000 x 50% = R25 000.
Page Number: 26
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-92
Content: 
The payout is calculated as follows: 10% of the Principal Severe Illness benefit x Severity of the claim = 10% x R600 000 x 50% = R30 000
10% of the Spouse Severe Illness Benefit x Severity of the claim = 10% x R500 000 x 50% = R25 000.
The benefit amount is therefore R55 000 (R25 000 +R30 000). This will be paid since it is less than the R135 000 maximum. The Life Fund is not reduced by this payout.
PARENTCARE (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC AND PURPLE LIFE PLANS)
Should the principal or spouse have purchased cover for either the Standard or LifeTime Severe Illness Benefits, an amount of cover is automatically included for the parents of the life assured.
ParentCare is provided without medical underwriting, but all claims which arise directly or indirectly from any physical defects, illnesses, bodily injuries or diseases, that the parent of the life assured suffered from, was aware of, or has received treatment or advice for before the commencement of the policy, are excluded.
ParentCare only applies to parents aged 70 and below at the time of inception of the principal’s or spouse’s Severe Illness Benefit. The automatic cover expires for each parent at the end of the month in which they turn 80.
HOW PARENTCARE WORKS
• A claim for any parent is limited to 5% of that parent’s child’s Severe Illness Benefit, up to R100 000 per parent.
• Where a parent is covered through more than one policy, a benefit payment may be made from each policy, subject to the aggregate payment not exceeding R100 000 per parent across all policies with Discovery Life.
Page Number: 26
================================================================================

Content: 
• Where a parent is covered through more than one policy, a benefit payment may be made from each policy, subject to the aggregate payment not exceeding R100 000 per parent across all policies with Discovery Life. The benefit payment will then be proportioned across each relevant policy in relation to the amount of the Severe Illness Benefit on each policy.
• The ParentCare benefit will be payable if the parent meets the criteria for an event listed under Severity A to D in Appendix 1. The parent must also be unable to perform three out of six Self-care Activities of Daily Living as indicated in Appendix 5, which must be measured three months after the claim event. No benefit is payable in the event of the parent’s death within three months of the claim event.

Content: SECTION 6
• Multiple claims are permitted subject to the overall maximum of R100 000 per parent.
• Benefit payments have no impact on the Life Fund.
• The automatic cover for parents covers the biological/adoptive parents of the insured life. A step-parent can also be covered provided that they have been nominated in writing prior to the step-parent meeting the criteria for a valid ParentCare claim. When you nominate a step-parent, you are required to declare any medical conditions which exist and which the step-parent, or you, know about or ought to know about, or for which the step-parent has sought medical attention for. Claims arising directly from these medical conditions are excluded from the automatic cover. A maximum of two parents may be covered for each assured life.
6.5 HOW DO THE SEVERITY LEVELS AFFECT BENEFIT PAYMENTS?
The Severe Illness Benefits have been designed so that benefit payments are proportional to the lifestyle impact of the severity of the illness itself. The assessment of the severity levels that apply to specific medical conditions is detailed in Appendices 1 and 2 and is based on objective medical definitions.
There are seven severity levels used to determine benefit payments. These levels have been set to ensure that benefit payments provide adequate cover for the impact that the severe illness is expected to have on your lifestyle.
The severity levels are as follows:
Severity Level A: pays 100% of the benefit cover Severity Level B: pays 75% of the benefit cover Severity Level C: pays 50% of the benefit cover Severity Level D: pays 25% of the benefit cover Severity Level E: pays 15% of the benefit cover Severity Level F: pays 10% of the benefit cover Severity Level G: pays 5% of the benefit cover.

The severity levels are as follows:
Severity Level A: pays 100% of the benefit cover Severity Level B: pays 75% of the benefit cover Severity Level C: pays 50% of the benefit cover Severity Level D: pays 25% of the benefit cover Severity Level E: pays 15% of the benefit cover Severity Level F: pays 10% of the benefit cover Severity Level G: pays 5% of the benefit cover. There are four cover options available:
• Comprehensive: covering severities A – D; or
• Comprehensive Plus: covering severities A – G; or
• LifeTime: covering severities A – D; or
• LifeTime Plus: covering severities A – G.
The LifeTime and LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefits include the LifeTime Severity Upgrades, applicable to severities A – D. Please refer to the Policy Schedule to see the option you chose when applying for your policy.
As mentioned in Section 2, the benefit cover is always expressed as a percentage of the Life Fund unless you have chosen the non- accelerated Severe Illness Benefit, in which case the benefit cover is expressed separately from your Life Fund.
6.6 EARLY CANCER BENEFIT
If you have selected the Comprehensive Plus or LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefit on your Life Plan, the Early Cancer Benefit will automatically be included. The benefit provides cover for qualifying in situ cancers and precancerous prostatic lesions.
Page Number: 27
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-96
Content:  The benefit provides cover for qualifying in situ cancers and precancerous prostatic lesions. Please refer to Appendix 2 for the full set of definitions covered.
Claims under the Early Cancer Benefit will be subject to an overall maximum claim amount. At benefit inception, this maximum amount will be determined (and will increase multiplicatively with the Cover and Financial Integrator percentages added to your policy). Multiple payments will be possible, subject to this overall maximum. Please note that this maximum will be reviewed annually. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the maximum amount relating to your policy.
EXAMPLE
Discovery Life stipulates that the maximum claim amount under the Early Cancer Benefit is R100 000. In this example, a client has taken out a Life Plan with Comprehensive Plus Severe Illness Benefit of R6 400 000. The client adds Cover Integrator at 40% and Financial Integrator at 20%. She later claims for a Severity G in situ cancer. The maximum claim amount will be set as follows: R100 000 x ( 1 + 40% + 20%) = R100 000 x 160% = R160 000. The pay-out will work as follows: Minimum (5% x R6 400 000, R160 000) = Minimum (R320 000, R160 000) = R160 000
Additionally, please note that the claims under the Early Cancer Benefit will be treated as part of the normal progressive claims process as described in Section 6.15. Furthermore, when paying out a claim in a set of progressive cancer claims, where one of the previous

claims was an early cancer claim under the Early Cancer Benefit, the severity percentage of this early cancer claim may be adjusted to allow for the fact that the full severity percentage may not have been paid out (due to the maximum claim amount). Please refer to the flowchart in Appendix 11 for a summary of how cancer claims under the Severe Illness Benefit are assessed and paid.
EXAMPLE
Ten months later, in the example above, the client's cancer progresses to Severity A. Her payouts will work as follows:
Second pay-out: [100% - (R160 00/R6 400 000)] x R6 400 000 = [100% - 2.5%] x R6 400 000 = 97.5% x R6 400 000 = R6 240 000
If your Severe illness Benefit is accelerated, the Early Cancer claim will reduce your Life Fund and your Minimum Protected Fund reinstatements will apply as usual, as described in section 2.6.2. If you select non-accelerated Severe Illness option, claims under the Early Cancer Benefit will not reduce your Life Fund.
No claims will be payable for any diagnosis in the first six months following the commencement of your Comprehensive Plus or LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefits. This will apply to any new benefits, additional cover as well as any reinstatements on your policy.
6.7 CANCER EXOME SEQUENCING BENEFIT (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE PURPLE LIFE PLAN)
The Cancer Exome Sequencing Benefit provides a payout to assist you with the cost of tumour sequencing for the principal, spouse and child lives assured (only if they are insured on your policy, excluding children only covered by the Automatic Child Severe Illness benefit) and will be automatically included in the Comprehensive, Comprehensive Plus, LifeTime and LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefits.

The Cancer Exome Sequencing Benefit provides a payout to assist you with the cost of tumour sequencing for the principal, spouse and child lives assured (only if they are insured on your policy, excluding children only covered by the Automatic Child Severe Illness benefit) and will be automatically included in the Comprehensive, Comprehensive Plus, LifeTime and LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefits.
Upon having the cancer exome sequencing performed and providing Discovery Life with an invoice (or other documentation as required) as proof of sequencing, the benefit payment will be made to you directly. This will be a non-accelerated pay-out and will not reduce your Life Fund. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the size of this benefit. This amount may change from time to time.
The Cancer Exome Sequencing Benefit covers a pre-defined list of cancers (as described in the list below) if:
1. Your treating specialist has recommended sequencing; and
2. The test has been performed.
The following cancers have been identified for exome sequencing:
• All stage 3 and 4 cancers except prostate cancer
• Stage 1 and 2 cervical cancer
• Stage 1 and 2 breast cancer with a high risk of recurrence according to genotyping.
Please note that this list may be reviewed from time to time – please refer to your Policy Schedule for the latest list.

Content: 
Please note that this list may be reviewed from time to time – please refer to your Policy Schedule for the latest list.
Multiple claims for unrelated events will be allowed up until a maximum of three times the Cancer Exome Sequencing benefit amount per life assured (as specified on your Policy Schedule), after which the life assured will no longer qualify for the Cancer Exome Sequencing Benefit. Please refer to Section 6.15 for a definition of unrelated claims. Please note that Discovery Life reserves the right to adjust this maximum per life assured over time.
CONDITIONS THAT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS UNRELATED CLAIMS:
• A relapse of a previous cancer or condition
• Two cancers present at the same time.
6.8 HOW DOES THE LIFETIME SEVERE ILLNESS BENEFIT WORK?
If you have selected the LifeTime or LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefit, your Severe Illness Benefit payment may be increased.
The extent to which your benefit payment may be increased depends on the following:
6.8.1 THE NUMBER OF LIFETIME SEVERITY UPGRADES FOR THE ILLNESS FOR WHICH YOU ARE CLAIMING
The number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades applicable to the life-changing event that you have suffered is calculated by taking into account:
• the expected duration of severe illness;
• the invasiveness of any surgery required;
• the impact of any therapy and rehabilitation required and its associated discomfort; and
• the impact of any assisted care and devices.

Content: 8.2 THE LIFETIME MAX THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED
You can choose a LifeTime Max of 100% or 200%. The LifeTime Max percentage represents the highest payment you will receive for your severe illness claim. Your LifeTime Max also determines the maximum number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades that you can receive for any set of related claims.
You can receive a maximum of:
• Four upgrades if you selected a LifeTime Max of 200%; or
• Three upgrades if you selected a LifeTime Max of 100%.
EXAMPLE
Consider the case where a client selects a LifeTime Max of 200% and claims for stage III cancer (Severity A). Stage III cancer qualifies for two LifeTime Severity Upgrades, so the benefit payment percentage is 150% (100% {Severity A} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}). Since this benefit payment percentage does not exceed the selected LifeTime Max, the full percentage will be paid out. However, if the client had selected a LifeTime Max of 100%, the benefit payment percentage will be limited to 100%.
6.8.3 THE NUMBER OF LIFETIME SEVERITY UPGRADES THAT HAVE BEEN PAID FOR PREVIOUS RELATED CLAIMS
Each LifeTime Severity Upgrade that you are paid will reduce the maximum number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades applicable to future related claims. Please note that on Classic, Purple and Essential Life Plans, all strokes will be deemed related to one another and all claims in the Heart and Artery category will be deemed related to one another in determining the impact on the maximum number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades.

================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-103
Content:  Please note that on Classic, Purple and Essential Life Plans, all strokes will be deemed related to one another and all claims in the Heart and Artery category will be deemed related to one another in determining the impact on the maximum number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades. For a set of progressive claims, the maximum number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades payable will not be reduced by any LifeTime Severity Upgrades that had been paid out for earlier claims for that specific progression. In addition, only the most recent claim in a set of progressive claims will be used to reduce the maximum number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades payable for other related claims. This is illustrated in the following examples.

Content: SECTION 6
EXAMPLE
A client (with no dependants) selects the accelerated LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit with a LifeTime Max of 200% as well as a Minimum Protected Fund of 100%. The choice of the 200% LifeTime Max means that the client may receive a maximum of four LifeTime Severity Upgrades for any set of related claims.
The client first claims for stage II cancer, which qualifies for two LifeTime Severity Upgrades. The benefit payment is 100% (50% {Severity C} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) of the Severe Illness Benefit amount. The Life Fund is reduced by the first claim, and then reinstated after 14 days to the original level by the Minimum Protected Fund.
The cancer then progresses to stage III Severity A cancer, which qualifies for two LifeTime Severity Upgrades. Although the client has already received two upgrades for a related claim, the fact that this new claim is a progression of the previous claim means that the previous claim has no impact on the number of LifeTime Severity Upgrades that the client may receive. As a result, the benefit payment percentage is 150% [Min (200%; 100% {Severity A} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades})], so the final payment will be the difference of the two payments (150% - 100%).
Effectively only two LifeTime Severity Upgrade of 25% has now been paid out for this set of related claims, which means the client still has the opportunity to claim a further two LifeTime Severity Upgrades for future related claims.

Effectively only two LifeTime Severity Upgrade of 25% has now been paid out for this set of related claims, which means the client still has the opportunity to claim a further two LifeTime Severity Upgrades for future related claims.
EXAMPLE
A client (with no dependants) selects the LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit with a LifeTime Max of 200% as well as a Minimum Protected Fund of 100%. The choice of the 200% LifeTime Max means that the client may receive a maximum of four LifeTime Severity upgrades for any set of related claims.
The first claim is for a Severity C heart attack, which qualifies for two upgrades. The benefit payment is 100% (50% {Severity C} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) of the Severe Illness Benefit amount. The Life Fund is reduced by the first claim, and then reinstated after 14 days to the original level by the Minimum Protected Fund.
The second claim is a Severity D heart attack which qualifies for three upgrades. The client has already used two upgrades on a previous claim related to this one. Since the client qualifies for a maximum of four upgrades and has already used two upgrades on the first heart attack, which was related to this claim, the client has only two upgrades for this claim. The benefit payment is 75% (25% {Severity D} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}).

================================================================================

Content:  The benefit payment is 75% (25% {Severity D} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}).
Since all four upgrades have been paid out for this set of related claims no further claims related to the heart attacks will receive a LifeTime Severity Upgrade. Any unrelated claim is still able to receive the four LifeTime Severity upgrades.
6.8.4 YOUR NUMBER OF FINANCIAL DEPENDANTS AT THE TIME OF CLAIM
Your financial dependants include your unmarried children who are younger than 18 and your spouse.
Your benefit payment may be further increased according to the number of financial dependants you have at the time of your claim. In order to receive a dependant increase, the following criteria need to be met:
• The condition is a Severity A or B illness (as defined in Appendix 1); and
• The condition qualifies for at least two LifeTime Severity Upgrades. If the above criteria are met an additional 5% for each dependant will be paid (subject to a maximum of 15%). This percentage will be added to the LifeTime Severity percentage after the LifeTime Severity Upgrades have applied. Only one dependant increase will be payable for a set of related claims, and this will be paid on the first claim which satisfies the above criteria.
EXAMPLE
Continuing with the cancer example, if the client has two financial dependants at the time of the claim, a further 10% {2 x 5%} will be paid out.
Page Number: 30
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-107
Content: 
EXAMPLE
Continuing with the cancer example, if the client has two financial dependants at the time of the claim, a further 10% {2 x 5%} will be paid out. This would give a total benefit payment percentage of 160% under the 200% LifeTime Max, or 110% under the 100% LifeTime Max.
In the case of the accelerated option, the Life Fund will be reduced by the full claim payout including the LifeTime Severity Upgrades and payouts for dependants. In the case of the LifeTime and LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefits, benefit payments may exceed the Life Fund. In this case, the Life Fund will terminate. However, should the Minimum Protected Fund have been selected, the Life Fund will be reinstated to the selected level after claim, irrespective of whether the benefit payment exceeded the Life Fund or not.
Please note that the LifeTime Severity Upgrades will not be applied to the automatic Child benefit as well as the ParentCare Benefit.

Content: SECTION 6
6.9 WHEN DOES THE SEVERE ILLNESS BENEFIT TERMINATE?
Discovery Life offers two options:
• Expiry at the end of the month in which you turn age 65: this means that claims submitted before the end of the month in which you turn 65 will be assessed and paid, but claims after the end of the month in which you turn 65 will not be accepted. You will therefore not be charged any premiums for the Severe Illness Benefit after the end of the month in which you turn 65.
• Whole of life: this allows cover for the whole of your life and requires payment of premiums until death.
For the Severe Illness Benefit on the Essential Life Plan, your cover and premiums will also cease if you claimed the full benefit amount (see section 6.16).
6.10 HOW DOES THE PREMIUM WAIVER ON SEVERE ILLNESS WORK?
The Premium Waiver on severe illness pays all premiums for benefits on the lives of the principal life, spouse and children in the event that the principal life becomes severely ill, according to the definitions of severe illnesses in Appendix 1. This includes waiving of the contributions for Vitality, if the policy is Health or Vitality Integrated, and waiving the contributions for Vitality Active if the policy is Active Integrated. This does not include the waiving of the Vitality drive or Vitality Money premiums.

Content:  This does not include the waiving of the Vitality drive or Vitality Money premiums.
There is no waiting period before commencement of premiums being waived. Premiums are only waived if the principal life meets Severity Level A of a severe illness defined in Appendix 1.
Assuming a plan was selected with premiums escalating annually at one of the premium escalation rates, the Premium Waiver covers these increases to a maximum of 20% per year. Discovery Life’s premium guarantee as detailed in Section 4.8 will be fully covered by this waiver benefit.
The benefit terminates at the earlier of principal life’s death and the end of the month in which the principal life turns 65, whether or not this benefit is in claim at that point in time.
6.11 WHAT OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCE MY SEVERE ILLNESS BENEFITS?
6.11.1 CHANGE IN OCCUPATION:
There are certain high-risk occupations for which Discovery Life applies premium loadings for the Severe Illness Benefit. Discovery Life reserves the right to amend your premiums or benefits should you alter your occupation to one considered to be of higher risk than your previous occupation.
6.11.2 MEDICAL UNDERWRITING:
Should Discovery Life decline or exclude cover for any previous or pre-existing medical condition, a claim that arises under any other body system that is directly related to or a consequence of the conditions or body system declined or excluded, will not qualify for a benefit payment.
6.12 HOW DOES THE GLOBAL HEALTH PROTECTOR WORK?
Discovery Life, in cooperation with a leading network of hospitals incorporating centres of excellence in the United States of America, can insure you and your family for medical procedures which, in the sole opinion of Discovery’s medical panel, are necessary and cannot be performed in South Africa, or where the probability of surviving such a procedure performed in the United States of America is significantly higher than if the procedure were performed in South Africa.

Content:  Please note that the premium guarantees described in Section 4.8 do not apply to this benefit and the premium for this benefit may be annually reviewable in light of a significant difference between current experience and the assumptions used when pricing, and with due consideration to the general economic and regulatory environment.
• The Global Treatment Benefit expires at the earlier of the end of the month in which you reach age 75 and the benefit expiry age of your Severe Illness Benefit, as indicated on your Policy Schedule. The Global Treatment Benefit included on the Child Protector Benefit will expire at the end of the month in which your child turns 18.
6.15 HOW ARE SUBSEQUENT CLAIMS ON THE SEVERE ILLNESS BENEFIT PAID?
The payment of the subsequent claim is dependent on whether the claim is progressive, related or unrelated:
• A progressive claim refers to conditions where a worsening of symptoms or stages of the disease can be expected, for example the progression of cancer, connective tissue disease or respiratory disease. For the Severe Illness Benefit, a relapse of a previous cancer will be assessed as a progressive illness. See Appendix 1 for more information on how subsequent cancer claims will be paid.
• A related claim is a claim where there is a link to a previous claim, for example, complications or consequences of a disease or injury previously claimed for.
Page Number: 34
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-122
Content: 
• A related claim is a claim where there is a link to a previous claim, for example, complications or consequences of a disease or injury previously claimed for. This would be where the later claim would not have arisen it if was not for the initial condition or illness. It also includes side effects or complications of treatment of the previously claimed for condition. Progressive claims are not included in this definition.
• An unrelated claim is a claim which is not related or due to the original claim.
In the calculation of the subsequent claim payment, reference is made to the severity level of the claim, which includes:
• The percentage due to the severity of the condition (for example, 100% for a severity A condition);
• The additional claim percentages due to the LifeTime Severity Upgrades under the LifeTime and LifeTime Plus Severe Illness Benefits(if applicable);
The claim payment formula for a subsequent claim will be made using the following formula:
Claim payment = Claim percentage x Benefit Sum Assured
This payment is made subject to the maximum payment on a benefit not being exceeded (as defined in Section 6.15).

Content: SECTION 6
Please note that various symptoms and signs of a syndrome, overlapping syndromes, associated conditions or treatments thereof, will be regarded as one condition. A syndrome is defined as a group of symptoms that consistently occur together or a condition characterised by a set of associated symptoms. Manifestations of other conditions as a result of the original condition will also be regarded as part of the original condition. Examples are, kidney failure due to severe systemic lupus erythematosis or manifestations of metastases in various organs. In addition, all cardiac and nervous system pathologies or procedures that occur within 30 days of each other will be regarded as a single event. Where a claim is defined for both a condition and its treatment, only the claim with the higher applicable category payout percentage will be paid. If you have selected the LifeTime Severe Illness benefit, any LifeTime Severity upgrades that either the claim or the treatment qualify for will be taken into account when determining the total payout percentage.
6.15.1 PROGRESSIVE CLAIMS
If the subsequent claim is a progressive claim, progressing to a higher severity level, then the claim payment formula for a Classic, Purple and Essential Life Plan is:
• Claim percentage = Difference in the applicable severity levels between the current claim and the highest severity level of previous claims paid in this progression
• Benefit Sum Assured = The sum assured calculated as if all the previous claims which form part of the set of progressive claims had not occurred.
EXAMPLE
You have a policy with the following details:
• Life Fund = R1 000 000
• Accelerated Comprehensive Severe Illness Benefit = R500 000.

Content:  Additionally, both the previous and recurrent cancer claims must qualify for at least a Severity D claim in order for a payment to be made.
Remission is defined as being cancer free after completion of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical treatment and biological therapy (if indicated) and confirmed by subsequent absence of radiological or biochemical (including molecular) evidence of disease. Hormone treatment is not regarded as active treatment for purposes of the remission definition.
If your recurrent cancer is at a higher stage, you may additionally qualify for a payment under the cancer progression rules. Multifocal or more than one invasive solid cancer lesion within the same organ that occurs at the same time is seen as a single life event.
If you take out the accelerated Severe Illness Benefit, your payment is calculated on the Severe Illness Benefit sum assured if there is cover remaining at the time of qualifying for the Cancer Relapse Benefit (This means that the claim will be made on the Severe Illness Benefit sum assured before the normal progressive claim payment has been deducted from it). If you take out the non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefit, your payment is calculated on the full Severe Illness Benefit sum assured before any progressive claims were deducted from it. This payment will be made in addition to the normal progressive cancer claims.

Content: SECTION 6
EXAMPLE
A client (with no dependants) on a Classic Life Plan selects the LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit with a LifeTime Max of 200%. His Life Fund is at R2 000 000 and his Severe Illness Benefit is at 50% of his Life Fund.
Claim 1:
The first claim is for a Severity D cancer, which qualifies for three upgrades. The benefit payment is 100% (25% {Severity D} + 3 x 25% {three LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) of the Severe Illness Benefit amount. The Life Fund is reduced by 100% x 50% x R2 000 000 = R1 000 000 and now is at R1 000 000.
Claim 2:
The client remains in remission for two years and then suffers a second progressive cancer claim. The second claim is diagnosed as a Severity A claim which qualifies for two upgrades. Since the claim is a progressive cancer claim, the full applicable LifeTime Severity upgrades are applied on each progressive claim (please see section 6.15 for further details). The benefit payment is (100% {Severity A} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) - (100% {Claim 1}) = 150% - 100%
= 50%. Ignoring the clients Annual Benefit Increases in this example, we will pay out 50% x 50% x R2 000 000 = R500 000. The sum assured of R2 000 000 is used because (for progressive claims) we assume all previous claims which form part of the set of progressive claims had not occurred. Please see Section 6.15 for more details.
Additionally, since the client remained in remission for at least one year, we will make an additional payment of 100% under the Cancer Relapse Benefit.
Page Number: 36
================================================================================

Content:  Please see Section 6.15 for more details.
Additionally, since the client remained in remission for at least one year, we will make an additional payment of 100% under the Cancer Relapse Benefit. This will be made on the reduced Life Fund amount (as described in 6.15) ie 100% x 50% x R1 000 000 = R500 000. So, in total, the client will receive R1 000 000 (Severity D claim) + R500 000 (Severity A progressive claim) + R500 000 (Cancer Relapse Benefit) = R2 000 000.
EXAMPLE
For the above example, the client now has the Minimum Protected Fund at 100%. His payouts will works as follows:
Claim 1:
The first claim is for a Severity D cancer, which qualifies for three upgrades. The benefit payment is 100% (25% {Severity D} + 3 x 25% {three LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) of the Severe Illness Benefit amount. The Life Fund is reduced by 100% x 50% x R2 000 000 = R1 000 000 and reduces to R1 000 000. After 14 days, it is restored to 100% of its value before the claim – back to R2 000 000.
Claim 2:
The client remains in remission for two years and then suffers a second progressive cancer claim. The second claim is diagnosed as a Severity A claim which qualifies for two upgrades. Since the claim is a progressive cancer claim, the full applicable LifeTime Severity Upgrades are applied on each progressive claim (please see section 6.15 for further details). The benefit payment is (100% {Severity A} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) - (100% {Claim 1}) = 150% - 100% = 50%.

================================================================================

Content: 15 for further details). The benefit payment is (100% {Severity A} + 2 x 25% {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) - (100% {Claim 1}) = 150% - 100% = 50%. Ignoring the clients Annual Benefit Increases in this example, we will pay out 50% x 50% x R2 000 000 = R500 000.
Additionally, since the client remained in remission for at least one year then we will make an additional payment of 100% under the Cancer Relapse Benefit. This will be made on the reduced Life Fund amount (and thereafter restored by the Minimum Protected Fund) ie 100% x 50% x R2 000 000 = R1 000 000.
So, in total, the client will receive R1 000 000 (Severity D claim) + R500 000 (Severity A progressive claim) + R1 000 000 (Cancer Relapse Benefit) = R2 500 000.
Please note that there will be a maximum of two cancer relapse payments, for each set of related cancer illnesses, over the duration of your policy.

Note that, on Classic, Essential and Purple Life Plans, all strokes will be deemed related to one another and all claims in the Heart and Artery category will be deemed related to one another.
EXAMPLE
You have chosen the Classic Life Plan with the Comprehensive Plus Severe Illness Benefit. If you have a heart attack of Severity C = 50%, followed by a subsequent heart valve repair (Severity B = 75%) at a later stage (where the second claim is not a progression of the first claim), these two claims would be regarded as related. The benefit payment for the first claim would be 50% of the sum assured. The benefit payout of the second claim will depend on whether you have the accelerated or non-accelerated benefit:
Accelerated Severe Illness Benefit
• Claim percentage = 75%
• Benefit sum assured = The Severe Illness Benefit remaining after your Life Fund was reduced by the 50% claim.
Non-Accelerated Severe Illness Benefit
• Claim percentage = 75%
• Benefit sum assured = The non-accelerated sum assured that was reduced by the 50% claim, before being reinstated 14 days later.

6.15.3 UNRELATED CLAIMS
You may claim regardless of the applicable severity level of the subsequent claim.
In the formula above:
• Claim percentage = The applicable severity level of the subsequent claim
• The Benefit Sum Assured depends on whether your Severe Illness Benefit is accelerated or non-accelerated:
– On the accelerated Severe Illness Benefit:
Benefit Sum Assured = the sum assured reduced by previous claims and reinstated by the Minimum Protected Fund (if applicable) as described in Section 2.6.2.
– On the non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefit:
Benefit Sum Assured = the sum assured reduced by previous claims, and reinstated back to the full sum assured after 14 days.
Simultaneous unrelated claims may occur as a result of the same event, for instance losing both an eye and an arm in the same motor vehicle accident. In this case, the claim with the highest severity level will be paid out first, and the second claim will be paid six months later, if the second condition is still present at the time. The second claim will be paid after the applicable reinstatement from the Minimum Protected Fund (on the accelerated Severe Illness Benefit) or after the full Sum Assured had been reinstated (on the non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefit).

6.17 HOW DOES THE GLOBAL EDUCATION PROTECTOR WORK?
The Global Education Protector pays for your child’s education should you or your spouse become severely ill, disabled or die. The insured event(s) on which your child’s education will be covered may be selected to be either of the following options:
• Death only, or
• Severe illness and disability, or
• Death, severe illness and disability.
For the death only and death, severe illness and disability options, you also have the option to choose whether the above insured events relate to your life only or to both you and your spouse’s lives. For the severe illness and disability option, the insured events relate only to your life.
Additionally, you may select between the two Global Education Protector benefit options:
• The Core Global Education Protector benefit option; or
• The Private Global Education Protector benefit option.
Both of these options will cover the official compulsory school or tertiary tuition fees charged by the education institution your child attends, subject to maximum benefit limits set by Discovery Life. Under both benefit options, an annual discretionary lump sum payment will be made directly to the legal guardian of the learner. The maximums and annual lump sum amounts will differ between the Core and Private benefit options.

Content: SECTION 6
There is also an University Funder benefit which is automatically included in the Global Education Protector benefit, subject to certain qualification criteria. This benefit will pay out a proportion of your child’s tertiary tuition fees when he/she begins tertiary education.
For the purpose of the Global Education Protector benefit, a ‘child’ is defined as a biological child of the life assured, or a child that has been legally adopted, or a child for which the principal or spouse are financially responsible.
6.17.1 GLOBAL EDUCATION PROTECTOR RISK COVER
This component of the Global Education Protector benefit pays for your child’s tuition (and, in the case of tertiary education, residence) as well as a lump sum amount for discretionary use, should the principal life or spouse become severely ill, disabled or die, as selected on the benefit.
Benefit payments cover the following years of education:
• Crèche – three years
• Pre-school – two years
• Primary school – seven years
• High school – five years

RISK COVER FOR TUITION AND RESIDENCE FEES (FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION)
Benefit payments will cover the actual compulsory education fees for tuition subject to maximums set out by Discovery Life per education phase.
The maximums set out by Discovery Life differ between the Core and Private options. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the maximums applicable to your chosen option. These maximums will increase annually at a rate which is linked to education inflation (as determined by Discovery Life). The increases may also differ between different phases of education. The education inflation used in the annual premium increase will be limited to 20%.
Where a learner is the recipient of a partial or full exemption of school fees due to a bursary or other forms of assistance, Discovery Life will cover the reduced education fee, subject to the maximums set by Discovery Life. In addition to this, Discovery Life will make a payment to the learner or their legal guardian equal to the amount of the bursary subject to the specified tuition maximum amounts for that year.
If the severe illness and disability option is chosen, then, should you die without having suffered a qualifying severe illness or disability claim event, as defined in Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 respectively, then the total premiums paid in respect of this benefit will be refunded. This payment will be made to the beneficiary.
The Global Education Protector benefit will also cover the actual fees for university residence (provided a valid residence acceptance letter or lease agreement can be provided, excluding those offered by parents or extended family members), up to a specified residence maximum.

The Global Education Protector benefit will also cover the actual fees for university residence (provided a valid residence acceptance letter or lease agreement can be provided, excluding those offered by parents or extended family members), up to a specified residence maximum. Please note that this maximum is separate from the maximum specified for the tuition fees and will differ between the Core and Private benefit options. This maximum will increase annually at a rate determined by Discovery Life, which is linked to education inflation. In any year, the maximum increase will be 20%.
Benefit payments will not be made should the child not attend an education facility for any reason whatsoever.

Content: SECTION 6
The benefit payments are made on an annual basis to the institution where the child is being educated and not to the policyholder directly. Should any legislation prevent funds being remitted directly to the education facility, Discovery Life reserves the right to pay the policyholder or beneficiaries directly.
Discovery Life will require proof of enrolment, proof of fees and the previous year’s schooling results, where applicable.
If the Private option is selected, the benefit payments may be based on the education fees of a select list of overseas universities, should the learner gain enrolment to a university on this list. The list of approved overseas universities may be altered by Discovery Life from time to time and can be obtained from your financial adviser or on the Discovery Life website. A different maximum based in US Dollars will apply if the child attends a university on the approved list.
Please note that if your child’s studies are covered by the Global Education Protector on multiple policies, the Global Education Protector benefit will only be paid out on one policy and will be subject to the maximums set by Discovery Life for this benefit.
If the child has received a benefit from the University Funder Benefit (described in Section 5.15.2) and a claim is received under the risk cover component of the Global Education Protector, in the same education year, the benefit payment will be reduced by any amounts already paid from the University Funder Benefit.

ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY LUMP SUM PAYMENT
In addition to the above cover for tuition and residence fees, an annual discretionary lump sum payment will be made directly to the legal guardian of the learner. These amounts will differ between the Core and Private options, and between the different phases of education. These lump sum payments may be used at your discretion, but are intended to cover the additional costs associated with education, for example: uniforms; stationery and textbooks; transport; sportswear; career counselling; technology (such as laptops and iPads), excursion fees; au pair fees; aftercare fees; remedial lessons or extra lessons or lessons with a tutor.
Please refer to your Policy Schedule for reference of the amounts you shall receive on claim. These may also change from time to time.

Content: titution, benefits paid will be based on the maximum education fees for South African facilities, and not the rate of fees applicable to education in their new country of residence. These maximums are defined in Rand terms. The overseas benefit payments will thus be converted from foreign currency into Rand when comparing the fees to the maximums applicable. The overseas university needs to be an accredited educational institution. This will be verified as part of the claims process. However, if the child is enrolled in a university on Discovery Life’s select list of overseas universities, and the Private option was chosen, benefit payments for the overseas university will be paid in full, subject to the maximums applicable to the overseas facilities at the time.
REPEATS AND FAILURES
For all the years up to the end of high school, the child may fail one year. In this case, Discovery Life will only pay 33% of the relevant fees and lump sum payment to repeat the year. Should the child fail again, benefit payments will cease until the child progresses to the next year of schooling.
Should a child attend a school which completes a grade over two years, the child will not be worse off than someone who has repeated a grade. Discovery Life will pay up to 133% of the applicable risk maximum over the two year period.

Content: SECTION 6
In the event of failing a year of university, diploma, trade qualification, or similar qualification in full, Discovery Life will not pay any benefit to repeat the year and benefit payments will cease until the child progresses to the next year of education. Failing two-thirds or more of the subjects in a year will be regarded by Discovery Life as failing the year in full. Discovery Life will only pay twice for a specific subject in the case of where the child fails less than two-thirds of the subjects in a year.
If the child progresses to the next year of education, having passed more than one-third of the previous year’s subjects, Discovery Life will continue to make benefit payments in full.
Discovery Life will only pay once for each year of tertiary education. For example, if the child changes course at the end of the first year when studying at university, Discovery Life will only pay for the new course once the child progresses to the second year of the new course.
BENEFIT EXPIRY AND THE CONVERSION FEATURE
Upon reaching the benefit expiry age of the Global Education Protector (the end of the year in which the child turns 24), or on earlier death of the child your premiums for this benefit will continue. These premiums are used to provide you with an additional amount of cover under the Life Cover Benefit, the Capital Disability Benefit and the Comprehensive Severe Illness Benefit on your existing policy.

Content:  These premiums are used to provide you with an additional amount of cover under the Life Cover Benefit, the Capital Disability Benefit and the Comprehensive Severe Illness Benefit on your existing policy. The premium will however be used to purchase cover on a separate policy in the following scenarios:
If you are older than the maximum entry age for additional cover on your policy.
• If the additional cover would result in you no longer qualifying for Comprehensive Integration.
• If the additional cover would result in an accelerated benefit exceeding the size of your Life Fund.
The details of the additional cover are as follows:
• If you selected the Global Education Protector to pay in the event of death only, the full premium is applied to purchase additional Life Cover and the benefit will be automatically converted to additional cover.
• If you selected the Global Education Protector to pay in the event of death, disability and severe illness, 40% of the premium is applied to purchase life cover, 40% is applied to purchase the Severe Illness Benefit and the remaining 20% is applied to purchase the Capital Disability Benefit. Should you be older than the maximum entry age for the Capital Disability Benefit on your policy, 60% of the premium will be applied to purchase the Severe Illness Benefit. Should you be older than the maximum entry age for Life Cover and the Severe Illness cover on your policy the premium will be applied to purchase the additional cover on a separate policy.

Content:  Should you be older than the maximum entry age for Life Cover and the Severe Illness cover on your policy the premium will be applied to purchase the additional cover on a separate policy.
• If you already have existing cover under the Severe Illness Benefit or Capital Disability Benefit on the same policy as the Global Education Protector, the cover options selected for the additional cover will be consistent with your existing cover option selected on these benefits.
• If you do not have existing cover under the Severe Illness Benefit or Capital Disability Benefit on your policy, the cover options selected for the additional cover will be the non-accelerated Comprehensive Severe Illness Benefit and non- accelerated Core Capital Disability Benefit. The Severe Illness Benefit purchased is for whole of life. The Capital Disability Benefit purchased will convert automatically at the end of the month in which the principal life turns 65 to the Severe Illness Benefit.
• The amount of cover purchased is based on your age, gender, smoker status and Funding plan at the benefit expiry. The same health loadings, hazardous pursuit loadings, occupational loadings and exclusions that applied to your Global Education Protector will be applied in calculating the additional cover purchased, without any additional medical underwriting. Such loadings and exclusions are automatically tranferred to the additional cover.

Content:  Such loadings and exclusions are automatically tranferred to the additional cover.
• Should the Global Education Protector have been selected to cover the first of principal life and spouse to suffer a life-changing event, additional cover will be granted to both lives at the benefit conversion date.

• This conversion of benefit is automatic, although the policy owner has the option of cancelling this additional cover. In this case, premiums for this additional cover will cease.
• The conversion of the benefit will only occur where there has been no claim on the Global Education Protector before its benefit expiry age.
• The conversion will only provide the Life Cover element, should there have been any claim on the Severe Illness/ Family Benefits or on the Capital Disability Benefit before the benefit expiry date of the Global Education Protector.
• Your Minimum Protected Fund percentage (if applicable) will remain unchanged after the conversion. The premium will therefore be used to purchase this additional cover as well.
If Discovery Life accepts a claim, benefit payments will cease at the earlier of:
• the child completing the undergraduate degree/diploma/trade certification or similar qualification, and
• the end of the education year in which the child reaches age 24.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Years of education must run consecutively. However, the child may take off one year between completion of high school and commencement of university or similar tertiary education. No benefit payments will be made for this year. The rules in the previous paragraph on cessation of benefit payments will still apply, which may result in benefit payments ceasing before the child completes his/her education.

Content:  The rules in the previous paragraph on cessation of benefit payments will still apply, which may result in benefit payments ceasing before the child completes his/her education.
Benefit payments for the Global Education Protector have no impact on the Life Fund.
The premiums for the Global Education Protector will increase annually at a rate determined by Discovery Life which is linked to education inflation plus an age-rated factor (which differs based on your selected funding plan). Please see Appendix 7 for details on the age-rated factors applied across funding plans. The education inflation used in the annual premium increase will be limited to 20%. In addition, the premium guarantees described in Section 4.8 do not apply to this benefit and the premium for this benefit may be annually reviewable in light of a significant difference between current experience and the assumptions used when pricing, and with due consideration to the general economic and regulatory environment.
6.17.2 UNIVERSITY FUNDER BENEFIT
The University Funder benefit is included automatically as a part of the Global Education Protector benefit subject to the following criteria:

Please note that a payment from the University Funder Benefit will only be made if the Global Education Protector benefit has been in force for at least five consecutive years. Discovery Life will fund the accumulated percentage of the child’s annual tertiary tuition fees for up to three years based on the child’s age at inception.

Content:  Discovery Life will fund the accumulated percentage of the child’s annual tertiary tuition fees for up to three years based on the child’s age at inception. The amount paid out is equal to:
Minimum (Annual tertiary education fees, Specified tuition maximum) x Accumulated percentage
The accumulated percentage is the sum of all the annual University Funder Benefit percentages accumulated (as per the table above) in each policy year (up to the end of the accumulation period as described above).
Please note that the specified tuition maximum above depends on whether the Core or the Private GEP option was chosen. These maximums may be reviewed annually in line with education inflation (as set by Discovery Life) – at the sole discretion of Discovery Life and these maximums may on average not increase by more than CPI + 3% each year. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the maximum applying to your policy.

Content: SECTION 6
EXAMPLE
A client purchases the Private Global Education Protector benefit when his child is 6 years old (age last birthday). Based on this age, Discovery Life will make two payments in respect of the University Funder Benefit when the child goes to university.
At the end of the year in which the child turns 18, the client has accumulated a University Funder Benefit percentage of 55%. The child's university tuition fees are R90 000 in their first year of tertiary studies. The maximum specified in his Policy Schedule is R100 000 at this point in time. Discovery Life will cover an amount of R49 500 = Minimum (R100 000, R90 000) x 55%. In the child’s second year of studies their tuition fees have increased to R120 000. The maximum specified in his Policy Schedule is R110 000 at this point in time. Discovery Life will cover R60 500 = Minimum (R110 000, R120 000) x 55% of the tuition fees. An illustration of the build up of the accumulated University Funder Benefit percentage, as well as the payouts are as follows:

Where a child is the recipient of a partial or full exemption of tuition fees in respect of their tertiary studies due to a bursary or other forms of assistance, Discovery Life will pay you directly an amount equal to the minimum of the bursary amount and the specified tuition maximum. If your child does not study at any tertiary institution, then a single, once-off payment will be made to you. This payment will be equal to the client’s accrued University Funder benefit percentage multiplied by half of the applicable maximum as that point in time. You must inform Discovery Life if the child will not attend an institution of tertiary education, in order to receive this payment. If Discovery Life is not informed of this, then the payment will be made at the expiry of the Global Education Benefit. If the child has not attended tertiary education by age 24 last birthday, then this payment will be made automatically.

Content:  If the child has not attended tertiary education by age 24 last birthday, then this payment will be made automatically.
EXAMPLE
A client purchases the Private Global Education Protector benefit when his child is 6 years old. At the end of the year in which the child turns 18, the client has accrued a University Funder Benefit percentage of 55%. The child does not attend tertiary education.
The benefit expires when the child turns 24. The maximum specified in his Policy Schedule is R140 000 at this point in time. The client will then receive a once-off payment of R38 500 = 50% x R140 000 x 55%.
The University Funder Benefit will only cover the tuition fees in respect of the child’s tertiary studies. Any further costs (for example, Residence, Textbooks and Stationery) will not be included in the University Funder Benefit and Discovery Life will not pay out any amount in respect of these costs.
The Vitality Statuses used in the calculation of the University Funder Benefit will always be those of the principal life insured.

Content: SECTION 6
In respect of the University Funder Benefit, ‘Tertiary Education’ will include all undergraduate degrees or recognised trade diplomas/certificates at all South African universities, as well as universities of technology (technikons). The overseas universities included in this benefit need to be accredited educational institutions. It does not include other local or overseas institutions providing trade qualifications (such as plumbing and electrical). If the child attends an overseas institution the University Funder Benefit payments will be limited to the applicable South African Tuition maximum (even if the institution is on Discovery Life’s select list of overseas universities).
Please note that the client requires Vitality in order to receive the University Funder benefit. If a client cancels their Vitality membership during their policy term, their University Funder Benefit will fall away completely.
If the Global Education Protector Benefit is lapsed or cancelled then no University Funder Benefit payments will be made
If a claim is made under the Global Education Protector Benefit, the University Funder Benefit falls away completely.
If any of your children’s studies are covered by the Global Education Protector benefit on multiple policies, the University Funder Benefit will only be paid out on one policy. In this scenario the University Funder Benefit with the highest accumulated fund at the time of pay-out will be paid.

Content:  In this scenario the University Funder Benefit with the highest accumulated fund at the time of pay-out will be paid. Should it become the case that tertiary education fees cease to be relevant in South Africa (for example, if the government fully funds tertiary institutions), then Discovery Life reserves the right to determine a different metric on which to base the calculation of the University Funder Benefit payment.

Content: DISABILITY BENEFITS
SECTION 7
7.1 WHAT DISABILITY BENEFITS DOES DISCOVERY LIFE OFFER?
Discovery Life offers you four kinds of Disability Benefits.
7.1.1 THE CAPITAL DISABILITY BENEFIT
The Capital Disability Benefit pays a capital amount in the event of you meeting the criteria for Category A, B,C or D (if applicable to your occupation) benefits as described under section 7.2 and 7.3. This medical impairment must be permanent. In the case of Category C, a percentage of the Capital Disability benefit amount will be paid while the permanency of your disability is being assessed. In addition, upon reaching the benefit expiry age of the respective disability benefit, the Capital Disability Benefit converts to the Severe Illness Benefit covering severity levels A and B only as defined in Appendix 1. For Capital Disability added through the Managed Care Integrator before 100% of the Life Fund was available, there will be no conversion to Severe Illness. The benefit expiry age of the Capital Disability Benefit may be 65 or 70 (i.e the benefit expires at the end of the month in which the individual turns 65 or 70).
7.1.2 THE ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY BENEFIT
If you do not qualify for Capital Disability, you may be offered the Accidental Disability Benefit. The Accidental Disability Benefit pays a capital amount in the event of you meeting the claim criteria for Accidental Disability as defined in Appendix 15.
Page Number: 48
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-169
Content:  The Accidental Disability Benefit pays a capital amount in the event of you meeting the claim criteria for Accidental Disability as defined in Appendix 15. There is no conversion to the Severe Illness Benefits upon reaching the expiry age for the Accidental benefit.
7.1.3 THE INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT
The Income Continuation Benefit pays you a regular income should you experience an illness or injury preventing you from working and a loss of income upon becoming fully or partially unable to follow your nominated occupation, as indicated in the Policy Schedule, due to injury or illness. The benefit pays an income until the earlier of you having recovered sufficiently from the disability to return to work, or until the end of the month in which you turn 65. After age 65 your claim will be assessed according to the post-retirement claims criteria (as per Appendix 12) and you may qualify to receive a monthly benefit based on your Long-Term Care Benefit amount.
7.1.4 THE OVERHEAD EXPENSES BENEFIT
The Overhead Expenses Benefit pays you, or in the case of a business-owned policy, the business, a regular income should your share of the qualifying overhead expenses not be met as a result of your becoming fully or partially unable to follow your nominated occupation, due to injury or illness as indicated in the Policy Schedule. These monthly expenses must continue during the period of disability.

Content:  These monthly expenses must continue during the period of disability.
7.1.5 THE PREMIUM WAIVER ON DISABILITY BENEFIT
The Premium Waiver on Disability Benefit pays all premiums for benefits on the lives of the principal life, spouse and children in the event that the principal life becomes permanently disabled. The Vitality premium will be waived if your policy is Health or Vitality Integrated. The premiums for Vitality Active will also be waived if your policy is Active Integrated. The Vitality drive and Vitality Money premiums will not be waived.
In this case, disability is assessed on the same definitions of medical Impairment applying to the Capital Disability Benefit, as defined in Appendix 4.
There is no waiting period before the commencement of premiums being waived, but premiums will only be waived if the principal life meets the Category A level of medical Impairment, as defined in Appendix 4, or the Category D definition of the Capital Disability Benefit (if applicable to your occupation).
Assuming a plan was selected with premiums escalating annually at one of the Premium Escalation Rates, the waiver benefit will cover these increases, but will be limited to a maximum of 20% per year. Discovery Life’s premium guarantee as detailed in Section 4.8 will be fully covered by this waiver benefit.
Discovery Life may ask you to provide satisfactory proof of your uninterrupted and continuous disability.

Content: 8 will be fully covered by this waiver benefit.
Discovery Life may ask you to provide satisfactory proof of your uninterrupted and continuous disability. If you cannot provide this proof, or if you perform any kind of work for payment or profit, your premiums will no longer be waived.
The benefit terminates at the earlier of:
• the end of the month in which the principal life turns 65, whether or not this benefit is in claim at that point in time;
• the principal life returning to work; and
• the principal life's death.
The Capital Disability Benefit, Accidental Disability and Income Continuation Benefit are further explained in Sections A, B and C in the following pages.

Content: SECTION 7
A. THE CAPITAL DISABILITY BENEFIT
7.2 HOW DOES DISCOVERY LIFE ASSESS QUALIFICATION FOR A BENEFIT PAYMENT?
The Capital Disability Benefit is assessed on the severity of your medical Impairment. By focusing on the effect that your medical Impairment has on you and your lifestyle, Discovery Life has developed an evaluation system that is objective and fair. Please refer to Appendix 4 for the complete list of impairments you are covered for.
DEFINITION OF NOMINATED OCCUPATION
The disability benefits use your nominated occupation when specifying the applicable claims criteria, so it is important to define what is meant by ‘nominated occupation’.
Your nominated occupation is the occupation that you are performing for all or the majority of your working hours and is as selected by you on the application form (you cannot select two occupations). It is the occupation that you are trained for, knowledgeable of and from which you derive all or the majority of your income and will be the occupation against which you are assessed under Category D (if applicable).
For any disability benefit assessed against the ability to perform the nominated occupation, disability will only be measured against the tasks and duties of the nominated occupation.
Should you change your occupation, Discovery Life must be notified in writing of this change (within six months of your changing your occupation).

Content: 
Should you change your occupation, Discovery Life must be notified in writing of this change (within six months of your changing your occupation).
7.3 AN OBJECTIVE AND FAIR SYSTEM IS USED TO ASSESS THE SEVERITY OF YOUR DISABILITY
Payments are evaluated on how severely your disability affects you. This benefit has four categories:
Category A – Pays out 100% of the benefit if your disability satisfies the criteria in Sections 1 to 12 of Appendix 4 for Category A.
Category B – Pays out 50% of the benefit if your disability satisfies the criteria in Sections 1 to 12 of Appendix 4 for Category B.
Category C – Pays out 2.5% of the benefit after a waiting period of four months if your condition does not satisfy the criteria for a claim under Category A or B as framed in Sections 1 to 12 of Appendix 4 but in the opinion of the medical panel of Discovery Life your condition may eventually satisfy the requirements for a valid claim under Categories A, B or D (if applicable) and subject to the further following conditions that:
• You continuously, for a period of four months, suffer from a medical impairment, injury or illness that, in the opinion of Discovery Life’s medical panel, renders you unable to fulfil the material and substantial aspects of your nominated occupation; and
• You are complying with the treatment regime prescribed by your treating medical practitioner; and
• You have lost more than 80% of your income earned from your nominated occupation (excluding any Disability Benefit payments from your Group Risk Benefits or other disability income benefits) continuously during the four month period.
You may claim again every four months thereafter as long as you satisfy the above criteria continuously over the previous four months.
Page Number: 49
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-174
Content: 
You may claim again every four months thereafter as long as you satisfy the above criteria continuously over the previous four months.
Category C benefit payments will reduce the Capital Disability Benefit and consequently, the Life Fund (if you have selected the accelerated Capital Disability benefit option). Each Category C claim is regarded as a separate life changing event for purposes of the Minimum Protected Fund so as to enable this benefit to re-instate cover, if applicable, after each Category C benefit payment has been made.
In a sequence of Category C claims for the same condition (or related conditions), the payment of each claim will be 2.5% of what the Capital Disability sum assured was immediately before the first Category C claim in that claim payment sequence. The onus will be on you to demonstrate every four months that you meet the criteria for another Category C claim.
You will receive a maximum of nine Category C payments regardless of whether or not such payments have been made for related or unrelated conditions.
Should you qualify for a Category A, B or D (if applicable) claim you will no longer be able to receive any further Category C payments for the same (or related) conditions. If the Category A, B or D (if applicable) claim is paid after any related Category C claim(s), the payment percentage will be reduced by 2.5% for every related Category C claim paid. In this case, the reduced payment percentage will be applied to the Capital Disability sum assured immediately before the first claim in the sequence of Category C claims for the same (or related) conditions was paid.

Content: 5% for every related Category C claim paid. In this case, the reduced payment percentage will be applied to the Capital Disability sum assured immediately before the first claim in the sequence of Category C claims for the same (or related) conditions was paid.
The Category C benefit is not available on the Essential Life Plan.

Content: SECTION 7
EXAMPLE:
Suppose that you take out a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with 80% Capital Disability Benefit, and suffer from a qualifying condition meeting the Category C claims criteria after policy inception.
Your Capital Disability sum assured is R1 000 000 x 80% = R800 000. Four months after your illness, the payment made to you will be 2.5% x R800 000 = R20 000, provided you meet the Category C claim criteria continuously for 4 months. This will reduce your Life Fund to R1 000 000 - R20 000 = R980 000 and your Capital Disability sum assured will reduce to R980 000 x 80% = R784 000.
If you claim again for the same (or related) condition four months later, and meet the Category C claim criteria, you will receive a further payment (calculated as if the Capital Disability sum assured had not been reduced by the first claim) equal to 2.5% x R800 000 = R20 000.
Your Life Fund will reduce to R980 000 - R20 000 = R960 000. If you continue to meet the Category C claim criteria for the same (or a related) condition on an ongoing basis, you will continue to receive payments up to a maximum of nine payments.
If after your second claim it becomes evident that your condition is not permanent and you recover, then payments will stop. However, if you qualify for a related Category A disability claim after your second claim you will then receive [100% - (2 x 2.

Content:  However, if you qualify for a related Category A disability claim after your second claim you will then receive [100% - (2 x 2.5%)] x [R800 000] = 95 % x R800 000 = R760 000. You will not be able to claim for this or related conditions under
Category C (or B or D) again.
Category D – Pays out 100% once it is established, to the satisfaction of Discovery Life, that you are totally and permanently unable to perform your nominated occupation (as indicated on your Policy Schedule) due to sickness, injury, disease or surgery.
Chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia are excluded under Category C and D. Category C and D are not available for certain occupations and this will be reflected on your Policy Schedule.
Please refer to sections 1 to 12 of Appendix 4 for details of the objective criteria and how they are used to establish the category into which your disability falls. Note that certain occupations do not qualify for Category C or D claims, as illustrated on your Policy Schedule. In addition, Category C is not available on the Essential Life Plan.
There are certain high-risk occupations to which Discovery Life applies premium loadings for the Capital Disability Benefit or which are excluded under the Category C and/or D benefits. Discovery Life reserves the right to amend your premiums or benefits should you alter your occupation to one considered to be of a higher risk than your previous occupation.

Content:  Discovery Life reserves the right to amend your premiums or benefits should you alter your occupation to one considered to be of a higher risk than your previous occupation.
Written notice of the event giving rise to a claim under Category C or D must be given to Discovery Life within four months after the date of the event.
7.4 THE CAPITAL DISABILITY BENEFIT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
You have the option of selecting one of the following four benefit options:
• Core: covering Categories A and D only; or
• Comprehensive Plus: covering Categories A, B, C and D; or
• LifeTime 200: covering Categories A, B, C and D; or
• LifeTime 300: covering Categories A, B, C and D.
The Accidental Disability benefit may be available to you if you do not qualify for any of the Capital Disability benefit options above. Please refer to Section B below for more information.
The LifeTime 200 and LifeTime 300 Capital Disability Benefits options include additional unique benefit features that are explained in Section 7.5.
Please refer to the Policy Schedule to see the option you chose when applying for your policy.
You may select an accelerated or non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefit (on any of the four options above). Please refer to your Policy Schedule to see which option you chose when you applied for your policy. Where the non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefit has been chosen, the benefit ceases when 100% of the sum assured has been paid out.

Content:  Where the non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefit has been chosen, the benefit ceases when 100% of the sum assured has been paid out.
Claims under the accelerated Capital Disability benefit will reduce the Life Fund, as described in Section 2 of the Individual Life Plan Guide. Where the non-accelerated benefit has been selected, benefit payments under this benefit will not affect your Life Fund or any of your other benefits under the Life Plan. Benefit payments from other accelerated benefits will likewise not affect your non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefit.

Content: SECTION 7
For young professionals, the non-accelerated benefit offers the option to take up Life Cover up to the Capital Disability Benefit amount, without medical underwriting, on the following events:
• Mortgage registration (limited to the bond amount)
• Marriage
• Birth or adoption of a child
• Professionals who establish a partnership
• Professionals who establish an incorporated practice.
A professional is defined in Appendix 13.
Discovery Life reserves the right to request an HIV test before granting increased cover. If the life assured tests HIV-positive, Discovery Life reserves the right to modify or cancel this increased amount. The option expires on your 30th birthday.
7.5 HOW DO THE LIFETIME BENEFIT OPTIONS WORK?
The LifeTime Capital Disability Benefit options provide you with enhanced payment(s) designed to reflect your financial needs at the time of claim and thereafter. You have the option of selecting either the LifeTime 200 or LifeTime 300 option. The unique additional features under these options are described below.
7.5.1 CATEGORY B CLAIM BOOST
Both the LifeTime 200 and LifeTime 300 options will boost all Category B claims from a 50% payment percentage to a 100% payment percentage. This boost will reduce the Life Fund where the accelerated Capital Disability benefit is selected.
7.5.2 MEDTECH BOOSTER
Discovery Life acknowledges that upon meeting certain medical criteria, you will potentially benefit from assistive devices utilising the latest medical technology.

7.5.2 MEDTECH BOOSTER
Discovery Life acknowledges that upon meeting certain medical criteria, you will potentially benefit from assistive devices utilising the latest medical technology. However, such devices carry significant upfront and ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs. The MedTech Booster, included in the LifeTime 200 and LifeTime 300 options, provides additional benefit upfront and ongoing payments for certain conditions, as specified in Appendix 4.
MEDTECH BENEFIT PAYMENTS
The MedTech Booster benefit payments will be paid out as an upfront payment, as well as ongoing payments. Under this benefit, you are eligible to receive a total of five ongoing MedTech Booster payments, payable every three years (while you are alive).
The first ongoing payment will be payable three years after the initial upfront payment is made. The ongoing payments are not adjusted by inflation or interest over time. Both the upfront and ongoing payments will be subject to a maximum lifetime amount, as specified on your Policy Schedule. At the time of a claim, should your upfront and ongoing payments exceed the maximum lifetime amount, the benefit payment will be reduced to the value of this cap. The maximum lifetime amount also represents the total benefit that a life insured can claim over their whole lifetime, so previous claims will count toward the maximum lifetime amount. Discovery Life reserves the right to update these maximum values at their sole discretion, from time to time and will notify you of any changes.

Content:  Discovery Life reserves the right to update these maximum values at their sole discretion, from time to time and will notify you of any changes. In order to be eligible for the ongoing payments, your Life Plan must be in force at the time of payment.
MedTech booster payments will accelerate the Life Fund where the accelerated Capital Disability benefit is selected. Should the sum of the payments under the MedTech Booster Benefit exceed the total value of your Life Fund the payments will continue so long as they are below the maximum lifetime amount specified for this benefit as shown in your Policy Schedule.
The size of the upfront and ongoing payments will depend on whether you have selected the LifeTime 200 or LifeTime 300 option, as well as the MedTech group that your claim qualifies for, as specified in the next section.

The MedTech Booster will apply to a number of conditions specified in Appendix 4. The conditions in Appendix 4 have been segmented into four groups, each with a different payment structure. These groups were designed and the conditions categorised, based on the expected severity and cost of medical technology associated with the relevant conditions. To ensure that the MedTech Categories as well as the defined payments are in line with advances in medical technology, Discovery Life may, from time to time, alter the MedTech groups to be applicable to each condition (as defined in Appendix 4), after consultation with Discovery’s medical specialists.

Please note that upon qualifying for a specified MedTech condition, you will receive the normal Capital Disability Benefit payment in addition to the upfront MedTech payment and ongoing MedTech payments. The Capital Disability Benefit will be paid as described in Section 7.3, with the exception of a Category B claim, which will be increased to 100% of your benefit amount.
MEDTECH BENEFIT CALCULATION
The upfront and ongoing MedTech payments will be calculated as follows:
Upfront MedTech payment
Upfront MedTech payment = Capital Disability Sum Assured x Upfront MedTech Payment Percentage
Ongoing MedTech payment
Ongoing MedTech payment in year t =
Total Ongoing MedTech Payment x Ongoing MedTech Payment Percentage payable in year t ÷ Total Ongoing MedTech Payment Percentage
Where Capital Disability Sum Assured is the sum assured used to calculate the base Capital Disability claim amount
Total Ongoing MedTech Payment = Capital Disability Sum Assured x Total ongoing MedTech Payment Percentage
Total Ongoing MedTech Payment Percentage = MedTech Percentage in Year 3 + MedTech Percentage in Year 6 + MedTech Percentage in Year 9 + MedTech Percentage in Year 12 + MedTech Percentage in Year 15.

Content: SECTION 7
EXAMPLE:
Suppose that you take out a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with 80% Capital Disability Benefit, giving a Capital Disability Sum Assured of R800 000, as well as selecting the LifeTime 300 option. Three years after policy inception, you suffer from a qualifying Capital Disability condition. ]The condition qualifies for a Category B Capital Disability claim as well as qualifying as a Group 1 MedTech claim.
Under the LifeTime 300 benefit the Category B qualifies for a boost from a 50% payment percentage to a 100% payment percentage. Therefore you will receive a Capital Disability payment of R 800 000 x 100% = R800 000 and also qualify for the upfront and ongoing MedTech payments under the LifeTime 300 option. The payout is calculated as follows:
Upfront MedTech payment
Upfront MedTech payment = Capital Disability Sum Assured x Upfront MedTech % = R800 000 x 50% = R400 000
This amount does not exceed the maximum lifetime amount for upfront payments, as specified on your Policy Schedule, so will be paid in full.
Ongoing MedTech payments
Total Ongoing MedTech percentage
= MedTech Percentage in Year 3 + MedTech Percentage in Year 6 + MedTech Percentage in Year 9 + MedTech Percentage in Year 12 + MedTech Percentage in Year 15
= 10% + 15% + 20% + 25% + 30%
= 100%
Total Ongoing MedTech payment
= Capital Disability Sum Assured x Total Ongoing MedTech percentage = R800 000 x 100% = R800 000.
These ongoing payments will be split into 5 payments payable every three years as seen below:
<table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>TOTAL ONGOING MEDTECH PAYMENT</th><th>PAYMENT PERCENTAGE</th><th>TOTAL BENEFIT PAID</th></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>R800 000</td><td>10%</td><td>R80 000 (R800 000 x 10%)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>R800 000</td><td>15%</td><td>R120 000 (R800 000 x 15% )</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>R800 000</td><td>20%</td><td>R160 000 (R800 000 x 20% )</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>R800 000</td><td>25%</td><td>R200 000 (R800 000 x 25% )</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><

The sum of the ongoing MedTech payments do not exceed the maximum lifetime amount applicable to this benefit, as specified in your Policy Schedule, so they will be paid in full.
In total, at claims stage, you will receive R800 000 (Category B claim) + R 400 000 (Upfront MedTech payment) = R1 200 000.
Additionally, over the 15 years following your claim event, you will receive R80 000 + R120 000 + R160 000 + R200 000 + R240 000 = R800 000. In total, you would have received R2 000 000, which is two and a half times your original sum assured amount.
The premium for the MedTech Booster is included in the premium for the LifeTime Capital Disability Benefit. The premium guarantees described in Section 4.8 do not apply to this component and the premium for this benefit may be annually reviewable in light of a significant difference between current experience and the assumptions used when pricing, and with due consideration to the general economic and regulatory environment.

7.6 HOW ARE SUBSEQUENT CLAIMS ON THE CAPITAL DISABILITY BENEFIT PAID?
The payment of the subsequent claim is dependent on whether the claim is progressive, related or unrelated:
• A progressive claim refers to conditions where a worsening of symptoms or stages of the disease can be expected, for example the progression of cancer, connective tissue disease or respiratory disease. A relapse of a previous cancer will be assessed as a progressive illness. See Appendix 4 for more information on how subsequent cancer claims will be paid.
• A related claim is a claim where there is a link to a previous claim, for example complications or consequences of a disease or injury previously claimed for. This would be where the later claim would not have arisen if it were not for the initial condition or illness. It also includes side effects or complications of treatment of the previously claimed for condition. Progressive claims are not included in this definition.

Content:  Progressive claims are not included in this definition.
• An unrelated claim is a claim which is not related or due to the original claim.

Content: SECTION 7
In the calculation of the subsequent claim payment, reference is made to the category of the claim, which includes:
• The percentage due to the Category of the condition (for example, 100% for a Category A or D condition);
• The additional payments due to the MedTech Booster under the LifeTime 200 and LifeTime 300 Capital Disability Benefits (if applicable).
The claim payment formula for a subsequent claim will be made using the following formula:
Claim payment = Claim percentage x Benefit Sum Assured
This payment is made subject to the maximum payment on a benefit not being exceeded (as defined in section 7.7).
Note that various symptoms and signs of a syndrome, overlapping syndromes, associated conditions or treatments thereof, will be regarded as one condition. A syndrome is defined as a group of symptoms that consistently occur together or a condition characterized by a set of associated symptoms. Manifestations of other conditions as a result of the original condition will also be regarded as part of the original condition. For example, the depression that arises after diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be considered as forming part of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Another example is where you are unable to perform four Activities of Daily Living after claiming for paraplegia. In addition, all cardiac and nervous system pathologies or procedures that occur within 30 days of each other will be regarded as a single event.

Content:  In addition, all cardiac and nervous system pathologies or procedures that occur within 30 days of each other will be regarded as a single event.
PROGRESSIVE CLAIMS
If the subsequent claim is a progressive claim, progressing to Category A or D from Category B, then the claim payment formula for a Classic, Purple or Essential Life Plan is:
• Claim percentage = Difference in the applicable category payout percentages.
• Benefit Sum Assured = The sum assured calculated as if all the previous claims which form part of the set of progressive claims had not occurred.
EXAMPLE:
You have a policy with the following details:
• Life Fund = R1 000 000
• Accelerated Comprehensive Plus Capital Disability Benefit = R500 000.
You claim for Category B kidney failure, where your claim percentage will be 50% (as this is a Category B claim) and your benefit sum assured is R500 000. Therefore, your benefit payout will be R250 000.
The illness then progresses to Category A kidney failure. The claim percentage for this second claim will be 50% (100% - 50%) and your benefit sum assured will still be R500 000, giving you a further benefit payout of R250 000.
In the case of a series of Category C claims progressing to a Category A, B or D claim, the claim percentage will be calculated as the difference in the new claim’s applicable category payout percentage and the total percentage of the benefit that has been paid out in the form of Category C payments. Please refer to the example in Section 7.3 for an illustration of how progressions from Category C claims are paid.

Content:  Please refer to the example in Section 7.3 for an illustration of how progressions from Category C claims are paid.
If you have selected the LifeTime 200 or LifeTime 300 options and your condition progresses from Category B to Category A, you will not qualify for another Capital Disability claim since a 100% claim would have already been paid for Category B conditions. However you may qualify for additional upfront payment from the MedTech Booster, subject to the applicable maximum amount specified in your Policy Schedule. Additionally, if your condition also progresses from one MedTech group to a higher MedTech group, you may also qualify for additional ongoing payments from the MedTech Booster, subject to the applicable maximum amount specified in your Policy Schedule.

Content: SECTION 7
EXAMPLE:
Suppose that you take out a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with 80% Capital Disability Benefit, giving a Capital Disability Sum Assured of R800 000, as well as selecting the LifeTime 300 option. Three years after policy inception, you suffer from a qualifying Capital Disability condition. The condition qualifies for a Category B Capital Disability claim as well as qualifying as a Group 1 MedTech claim. Under the LifeTime 300 benefit the Category B qualifies for a boost from a 50% payment percentage to a 100% payment percentage. Therefore you will receive a Capital Disability payment of R800 000 x 100% = R800 000 and also qualify for the upfront and ongoing MedTech payments under the LifeTime 300 option.
A year later your condition progresses to a Category A Capital Disability claim. No further payment will be made from the Capital Disability Benefit since a 100% payment has already been made for the Category B disability. However you qualify for further payments from the MedTech Booster Benefit as described below:
Upfront MedTech payment
Additional upfront MedTech payment = Capital Disability Sum Assured x Upfront MedTech % = R800 000 x (100% - 50%) = R400 000 This amount does not exceed the maximum lifetime amount for ongoing payments, as specified on your Policy Schedule, so will be paid in full.
Ongoing MedTech payments
Since the condition did not progress from one MedTech group to another you will not qualify for an increase on the ongoing MedTech payments that you would qualify for under a Category B Capital Disability.

Note that, on Classic, Essential and Purple Life Plans, all strokes will be deemed related to one another and all claims in the Cardiovascular system category will be deemed related to one another.
Also note that the rules for related claims above will also apply to the benefit payments payable under the MedTech booster if you have selected the LifeTime 200 or LifeTime 300 options. Related claims will also be subject to the maximum lifetime amount for this benefit.
UNRELATED CLAIMS
In the formula above:
• Claim percentage = The applicable category payout level of the subsequent claim
• The Benefit Sum Assured depends on whether your Capital Disability Benefit is accelerated or non-accelerated:
On the accelerated Capital Disability Benefit:
Benefit Sum Assured = the sum assured reduced by previous claims and reinstated by the Minimum Protected Fund (if applicable) as described in Section 2.6.2.
On the non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefit:
Benefit Sum Assured = the sum assured reduced by previous claims.

Content: SECTION 7
EXAMPLE:
You have chosen the Classic Life Plan with the accelerated Comprehensive Plus Capital Disability Benefit. If you lost all sight in one eye (Category B – 50%), followed by a complete loss of the use of your hand (Category A – 100%) at a later stage (where the second claim is not a progression of the first claim), these two claims would be regarded as unrelated. The benefit payment for the first claim would be 50% of the sum assured. The benefit payout of the second claim will be 100% of the sum assured after the Life Fund was reduced by the first claim.
Note that the rules for unrelated claims above will also apply to the benefit payments payable under the MedTech booster if you have selected the LifeTime 200 or LifeTime 300 options. Unrelated claims will also be subject to the maximum lifetime amount for this benefit.
ADDITIONAL CLAIM CRITERIA
Once a 100% claim has been paid for Category A or D conditions (as defined in Section 1 to 12 of Appendix 4), a subsequent Category A, B or C claim will only be considered for conditions that are unrelated to the applicable Category A or D conditions or manifestations of those conditions.
In addition, no further claims will be payable under the Other claims definitions (as defined in Section 1 to 12 of Appendix 4) or under the Category D definition of disability.
After a Capital Disability claim for Category A, B or D has been made for any condition, subsequent claims for mental and behavioural disorders will only be considered if the criteria for a Category A claim in respect of mental and behavioural disorders as listed in the Mental and Behavioural Disorders section in Appendix 4 are met and are not a manifestation of the previous claim paid.

7.7 WHAT ARE THE BENEFIT MAXIMUMS ON SUBSEQUENT CLAIMS?
The maximum amount that you can receive under the various Capital Disability Benefits is shown in the table below. Note you may be able to exceed these maximums if you have the LifeTime 200 or LifeTime 300 Capital Disability Benefits, however the maximum lifetime amount will apply for payments from the MedTech Booster Benefit.

7.8 HOW DOES THE CONVERSION TO THE SEVERE ILLNESS BENEFIT WORK?
For all Capital Disability Benefit options, upon reaching the benefit expiry age of the Capital Disability Benefit, your premiums for this benefit will continue. These premiums are used to provide you with an additional amount of cover under the Severe Illness Benefit and/or LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit (Severity Levels A and B only and excluding both the Cancer Relapse Benefit and the Global Treatment Benefit). For Capital Disability added through the Managed Care Integrator before 100% of the Life Fund was available, there will be no conversion to Severe Illness.
The Core and Comprehensive Plus Capital Disability Benefits convert to the Comprehensive Severe Illness Benefit, whereas the LifeTime 200 and LifeTime 300 Capital Disability Benefits convert to the LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit.

================================================================================

Content: 
The Core and Comprehensive Plus Capital Disability Benefits convert to the Comprehensive Severe Illness Benefit, whereas the LifeTime 200 and LifeTime 300 Capital Disability Benefits convert to the LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit. In all cases, the additional Severe Illness Benefit cover will be for whole of life. Any non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefits will convert to provide you with non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefit on the same policy as your Life Fund.
For the Core and Comprehensive Plus options, the amount of Severe Illness Benefit that will be provided depends on the benefit expiry age of the relevant disability benefit and the claim categories covered:

Content: SECTION 7
• Disability Benefit expiry age of 65:
– Core: 55% of disability benefit amount
– Comprehensive Plus: 75% of disability benefit amount.
• Disability Benefit expiry age of 70:
– Core: 70% of disability benefit amount
– Comprehensive Plus: 90% of disability benefit amount.
For the LifeTime 200 and LifeTime 300 options, the amount of LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit that will be provided depends on the benefit expiry age of the relevant disability benefit and the benefit option selected. Your selected benefit option also determines the LifeTime Max that will apply:
• LifeTime Capital Disability Benefit expiry age of 65:
– LifeTime 200: 75% of disability benefit amount, with a LifeTime Max of 100%
– LifeTime 300: 80% of disability benefit amount, with a LifeTime Max of 200%.
• LifeTime Capital Disability Benefit expiry age of 70:
– LifeTime 200: 90% of disability benefit amount, with a LifeTime Max of 100%
– LifeTime 300: 95% of disability benefit amount, with a LifeTime Max of 200%.
This conversion in cover will be automatic, although the policy owner has the option of cancelling this additional Severe Illness Benefit cover. In this case, premiums for this benefit will no longer be payable and cancellation of this cover will have no impact on premiums for other benefits and premium guarantees on the policy. The converted accelerated Severe Illness Benefit will be the new qualifying benefit.

Content:  The converted accelerated Severe Illness Benefit will be the new qualifying benefit.
Life-changing events and related conditions which occur before the conversion will not be covered after conversion to the Severe Illness Benefit irrespective of whether the illness progresses to a higher severity after conversion.
If you also have a separate Severe Illness Benefit on your Life Fund, you will be able to claim for both that benefit and your converted Severe Illness Benefit (if you qualify for a Severity A or B severe illness). Both benefits will pay out the full sum assured, even if this exceeds the value of the Life Fund at the time of claim.
If you are receiving Ongoing MedTech payments when your Capital Disability benefit expires the payments will continue.
7.9 AUTOMATIC IMPAIRMENT COVER FOR CHILDREN (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC AND PURPLE LIFE PLANS)
Should the principal or spouse be covered under the Capital Disability Benefit, an amount of Impairment cover is automatically included for their children. The children will be covered for all conditions found in Section 14 in Appendix 4. Discovery Life, may from time to time review these conditions to ensure they are up to date and relevant.
The Automatic Child Impairment Benefit has been designed so that the benefit payments are commensurate with the impact of the impairment itself. There are seven Impairment Severity levels used to determine benefit payments.

Content:  There are seven Impairment Severity levels used to determine benefit payments.
The impairment severity levels are as follows:
• Impairment Severity Level A: pays 100% of the benefit cover
• Impairment Severity Level B: pays 75% of the benefit cover
• Impairment Severity Level C: pays 50% of the benefit cover
• Impairment Severity Level D: pays 25% of the benefit cover
• Impairment Severity Level E: pays 15% of the benefit cover
• Impairment Severity Level F: pays 10% of the benefit cover
• Impairment Severity Level G: pays 5% of the benefit cover.
The cover for each child in the family is provided without medical underwriting, but all claims which arise directly or indirectly from any physical defects, illnesses, bodily injuries or diseases, that your child suffered from, or has received treatment or advice for or that you or your child were aware of, before the commencement of the policy, are excluded.
This cover expires at the end of the month in which the child turns 18.

The benefit payment for any child is based on 10% of the parents’ aggregate sum assured for the Capital Disability Benefit multiplied by the relevant Impairment Severity percentage, per claim event. These claims have no impact on the Life Fund. This payout is limited to the specified maximum amount for automatic cover for children. The maximum amount payable per child, will apply across all policies with Discovery Life where either parent is insured under the Severe Illness Benefit. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for this maximum amount. Discovery Life reserves the right to review this maximum each year. Additionally, multiple claims are allowed under this benefit – however only up to this maximum amount.
The flowchart in Appendix 10 summarises the payment of subsequent claims.
EXAMPLE:
A principal and a spouse purchase a Life Fund of R1 000 000. The principal has 60% Capital Disability Benefit (R600 000) and the spouse has 50% Capital Disability Benefit (R500 000). The specified maximum amount of automatic impairment cover for children is R135 000.
Their child loses a thumb and index finger due to a traumatic event and qualifies for an impairment Severity C (50%) claim.

Content: 
Their child loses a thumb and index finger due to a traumatic event and qualifies for an impairment Severity C (50%) claim.
The payout is calculated as follows: 10% of the Principal Capital Disability Benefit x Impairment payment percentage = 10% x R600 000 x 50% = R30 000 10% of the Spouse Capital Disability Benefit x Impairment payment percentage = 10% x R500 000 x 50% = R25 000. The payment amount is therefore R55 000 (R25 000 +R30 000).
This will be paid since it is less than the R135 000 maximum. The Life Fund is not reduced by this payout.

B. THE ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY BENEFIT
Accidental Disability will only be offered as an option to lives who apply for Capital Disability but are declined the cover as a result of a medical condition. The Accidental Disability Benefit will have the same rules applying to it as the Capital Disability Benefit except as specified below. Where the benefits differ, it is highlighted below.
7.10 HOW DOES DISCOVERY LIFE ASSESS QUALIFICATION FOR A BENEFIT PAYMENT?
An accident means a sudden and unforeseen event occurring at an identifiable place and time, which has a visible, violent and external cause, and results in the specified impairments. A claim for a qualifying Life Assured under this benefit will be considered if:
• The claimant suffers an injury that is directly the result of an accident.
• The injury satisfies the claims criteria framed in Appendix 15.
• The claimant survives for a period of three months after the accident which gave rise to the claim.
On meeting the criteria for a claim, 100% of the Accidental Disability Benefit is paid out.
Accidental Disability is an accelerated benefit and so the payout will reduce the Life Fund. In the event that both the Capital Disability and Accidental Disability Benefits are included for the same life assured on a policy, the payouts will both be based on the Life Fund before the claim.
EXAMPLE:
A Life Assured has a R1 000 000 Life Fund.
Page Number: 59
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-206
Content: 
EXAMPLE:
A Life Assured has a R1 000 000 Life Fund. They have selected 20% Capital Disability and 60% Accidental Disability. The Life Assured is in a car accident and qualifies for a claim under both the Capital Disability and the Accidental Disability. The claim payouts are both based on the Life Fund in force prior to the claim, R1 000 000. The payouts are:
Capital Disability: R1 000 000 x 20% = R200 000 Accidental Disability: R1 000 000 x 60% = R600 000
The Accidental Disability Benefit is not considered a qualifying ancillary for Comprehensive Integration or the Access Cover benefit. There is no conversion to Severe Illness upon reaching the expiry age of the benefit. The expiry age is indicated in your Policy Schedule.
7.11 HOW ARE SUBSEQUENT CLAIMS ON THE ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY BENEFIT PAID?
No subsequent claim will be made for related or progressive claims. For unrelated claims, you may qualify for a payment on a subsequent claim as long as there is sufficient Life Fund remaining to fund the additional benefit payments. This payment is made subject to the maximum payment on a benefit not being exceeded (as defined in section 7.12).
The claim payment formula for a subsequent unrelated claim will be made using the following formula:
Claim payment = Claim percentage x Benefit Sum Assured
In the formula above:
• Claim percentage = the applicable category payout level of the subsequent unrelated claim
• Benefit Sum Assured = the sum assured reduced by previous claims and reinstated by the Minimum Protected Fund.

Content: 
7.12 WHAT ARE BENEFIT MAXIMUMS ON SUBSEQUENT CLAIMS?
The maximum amount that you may claim is 100% of the original sum assured, increased with annual benefit increases, for all claims. The Minimum Protected Fund can only increase the total claims payout to 200% of the original sum assured, increased with annual benefit increases.

Content: SECTION 7
C. THE INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT
The Income Continuation Benefit pays you a regular income if you are disabled and unable to perform your nominated occupation due to injury, illness or disability.
DEFINITION OF NOMINATED OCCUPATION
The Income Continuation Benefit uses your nominated occupation when specifying the applicable claims criteria, so it is important to define what is meant by ‘nominated occupation’. Your nominated occupation is the occupation that you are performing for all or the majority of your working hours and is as selected by you on the application form (you cannot select two occupations). It is the occupation that you are trained for, knowledgeable of and from which you derive all or the majority of your income. For any claim assessed against the ability to perform your nominated occupation, inability to perform your nominated occupation will only be measured against the tasks and duties of your nominated occupation. The monthly income amount that you insure for your nominated occupation must be what you derive from or is in respect of the nominated occupation you have specified.
7.13 WHAT INCOME CAN BE PROTECTED BY THE INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT?
Since the Income Continuation Benefit is designed to protect your monthly income in the event of disability, it is important to define what is meant by income. Income is defined as follows:
• In the case of your being a salaried employee, it shall be your monthly cost-to-company less any PAYE tax, as per your payslip.
Page Number: 60
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-209
Content:  Income is defined as follows:
• In the case of your being a salaried employee, it shall be your monthly cost-to-company less any PAYE tax, as per your payslip. Note that discretionary bonuses are not included in monthly cost-to-company but can be insured under the Performance Bonus Protector if you have the Comprehensive Income Continuation benefit (see Section 7.16.6).
• In the case of your being a sole proprietor, partner, member of a close corporation or director of a private company, it shall be your monthly share of fees for services rendered and gross profit from trading activities, less your monthly share of the business overhead expenses and tax. Gross profit from trading activities is defined as monthly sales less cost of sales. The tax is calculated using tax tables and is based on your income not reduced by tax. Where it is difficult to determine your share of the income or expenses of the business, it shall be any income, dividends, loan account repayments and other benefits you derive from the business in your personal capacity, less tax (as per tax tables).
• Income for the purposes of this definition shall exclude passive income from assets such as property or shares in a business acquired purely for investment purposes and where you are not engaged in the management of this business.
The definition above applies to all instances where ‘income’ is mentioned under the Income Continuation Benefit Section.

================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-210
Content: 
The definition above applies to all instances where ‘income’ is mentioned under the Income Continuation Benefit Section.
When a claim is submitted, Discovery Life will request your average monthly income from your nominated occupation for the 12 month period prior to your disability. This is referred to as your pre-disability income. Your pre-disability income will be adjusted with the applicable annual benefit escalation rate when used in the different claim payment calculations in the Income Continuation Benefit Section. If your income is of a variable nature, Discovery Life may determine a period other than 12 months to calculate average monthly income. Discovery Life will not take into account a sabbatical in the calculation of average income. Discovery Life will allow a maximum sabbatical term of six months every three years (a sabbatical is defined as a period of leave from employment which does not fall within the employee’s employment contract). A claim submitted during a sabbatical will be assessed on whether you are medically certified to be able to perform your nominated occupation.
You have 90 days from the date of the event to prove your income over the last 12 months before disability. This 90-day period will remain unchanged even if you submit multiple claims relating to the same life changing event. Should you not have correctly disclosed your income to us at application stage or when you have effected changes to the policy, Discovery Life reserves the right to recoup any benefit overpayments as well as terminate the benefit with no further benefit payments.

================================================================================

Content:  Should you not have correctly disclosed your income to us at application stage or when you have effected changes to the policy, Discovery Life reserves the right to recoup any benefit overpayments as well as terminate the benefit with no further benefit payments. If you have no income at the time of the condition giving rise to the claim and you are not on a sabbatical you will not be able to claim as there is no loss of income due to the condition (for example if you have been retrenched or if you have resigned from your nominated occupation or if you are in prison). Any claim made within 12 months of returning to work following a period of retrenchment will exclude the period of retrenchment for the purposes of calculating your pre-disability income.
It is in your interest to provide Discovery Life with your latest monthly income at each policy anniversary. This will assist in preventing you from becoming over or under-insured. Note that only income received from your nominated occupation will be covered by this benefit.

7.14 THE INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
Your Income Continuation Benefits will differ depending on whether you qualify for the Comprehensive option (i.e. you have a Classic or Purple Life Plan) or the Essential option (i.e. you have an Essential Life Plan). The differences will be explained in each relevant section below.
The Income Continuation Benefit has four waiting periods to choose from:
• Seven days
• One month
• Three months
• Twelve months.
The waiting period you select is the period for which you will need to be continuously and totally disabled due to injury or illness (after consulting with a registered medical practitioner) before you can start claiming for a temporary disability (as defined in Section 7.15.1). One month is considered to be 30 calendar days.
Note that only full days booked off contribute towards the waiting period. If you recover or are rehabilitated and claim again for the same cause which resulted in your original inability to perform your nominated occupation within three months of recovery, the waiting period will be waived for the subsequent claim. This is known as the ‘off-period’.
At age 65, the Income Continuation Benefit will convert to the Long-Term Care Benefit.
You may also select the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit.

================================================================================

Content: 
You may also select the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit. This benefit pays out an amount in addition to your Income Continuation Benefit amount when you claim under the Income Continuation Benefit, subject to the Maximum Benefit Amount (Section 7.22.3). The Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit will provide a payment for up to 24 months (less the selected waiting period, for temporary disability claims). The same waiting period applies to your Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit. The Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit, along with its premiums, will cease at the end of the month in which you turn 65.
The premiums for your Income Continuation Benefit, Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit, Performance Bonus Protector and Buy-up Income Continuation Fund will increase annually according to the plan type selected on you policy (which are described in Appendix 8) plus an additional 0.5% each year. You may also select a different increase option for your Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit than for the rest of the benefits on your policy. However for the AcceleRater and FlexRater Funding Plans you must select a premium increase option that depends on age.
Please refer to your Policy Schedule to see the options that you have selected.

7.15 WHAT HAPPENS IF I BECOME TEMPORARILY DISABLED BEFORE AGE 65?
This section explains the benefit payments made for temporary disability (as defined in Section 7.15.1) suffered prior to age 65.
7.15.1. HOW DO I QUALIFY FOR A TEMPORARY DISABILITY CLAIM?
There are a number of underpins which allow you to claim for a temporary disability. If you qualify for a claim under multiple underpins, your claim will be based on the underpin which pays out the highest benefit amount.
AUTOMATIC SICKNESS UNDERPIN
You can claim under the Automatic Sickness Underpin if you have been booked off by a medical professional due to illness. For this underpin, you will not be required to provide proof of loss of income for the first 24 months after the disability event. This underpin pays until the month in which you turn age 65. However, because you need to provide proof of loss of income after the first 24 months, you will effectively start claiming under the Loss of Income Underpin (see below) from that point onwards.
The disability event is the event that resulted in your inability to perform your nominated occupation. Your payments will also not be reduced by any earnings you generated during the benefit payment period. However, your payments will be reduced if you receive income in the form of other disability income/sickness benefits (see Section 7.22.5).
You and your treating doctor will still be required to complete Discovery Life’s Income Continuation Benefit claim forms.

Content: 22.5).
You and your treating doctor will still be required to complete Discovery Life’s Income Continuation Benefit claim forms. Discovery Life’s medical panel reserves the right to request any additional medical information that it deems necessary.
LOSS OF INCOME UNDERPIN
You can claim under the Loss of Income Underpin (after consulting a medical practitioner) by providing proof that you are unable to perform your nominated occupation due to your injury or illness, and as a result are unable to maintain your income level. You may only claim under the Loss of Income Underpin if you are unable to perform at least 25% of the main duties of your nominated occupation. This underpin pays until the month in which you turn age 65.

Content: SECTION 7
LIFETIME SEVERE ILLNESS BENEFIT UNDERPIN
If you suffer a Severity A severe illness (as defined in Appendix 1), the LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit Underpin pays 100% of your monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amount (if selected), increased by an additional 25% for each LifeTime Severity Upgrade that applies to the specific claim definition of your illness. If your condition qualifies for a severity A Severe Illness Benefit claim with at least two LifeTime Severity Upgrades, you may also receive a further 5% of your benefit amount for each financial dependant you have at the time of your claim (up to 15%). Your benefit will be paid for six months for policies with a seven-day waiting period, or five months for policies with a one-month waiting period, once your selected waiting period has expired. This underpin does not apply to waiting periods longer than one month.
Please note that the Cancer Relapse Benefit, as discussed in section 6.15.1.1, does not apply to payments under the LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit Underpin.
EXAMPLE:
Consider the case where you have an Income Continuation Benefit with a R50 000 monthly benefit and a seven-day waiting period. If you suffer a Severity A heart attack (which qualifies for two LifeTime Severity Upgrades as per Appendix 1), you will receive R75 000 (R50 000 sum assured + R50 000 x 25% x 2 {two LifeTime Severity Upgrades}) for six months once your waiting period has expired.
If you had two financial dependants at the time of your claim, you would receive an additional monthly amount of R5 000 (2 x 5% x R50 000), giving a total benefit payment of R80 000.

If you had two financial dependants at the time of your claim, you would receive an additional monthly amount of R5 000 (2 x 5% x R50 000), giving a total benefit payment of R80 000.
INJURY AND HOSPITALISATION UNDERPIN
The Injury and Hospitalisation Underpin pays 100% of your monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit amount (if selected) if you fracture certain bones or are hospitalised for longer than a week. Please refer to Appendix 4 for the list of fractures and medical events you can claim for and their associated payment periods. This underpin does not apply to waiting periods longer than one month.
Please note: All payments made will be subject to the Maximum Benefit Amount (Section 7.22.3).
7.15.2. CAN I PROTECT MY FULL INCOME IF I AM TEMPORARILY DISABLED?
You can insure up to 75% of your income with the Income Continuation Benefit. You may also select the Top-up Income Continuation Benefit and insure up to a further 25% of your income. If you qualify for a temporary disability claim, you will receive your selected Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit.
All payments made will be subject to the Maximum Benefit Amount (as defined in Section 7.22.3).
Any exclusion clauses that apply on your Income Continuation Benefit will also apply to your Top-up Income Continuation Benefit.

Content: 22.3).
Any exclusion clauses that apply on your Income Continuation Benefit will also apply to your Top-up Income Continuation Benefit. Your benefit payments are made on the last business day of each calendar month. Each monthly payment will be pro-rated so that you are paid for the portion of the month for which you qualify for a benefit payment.
7.15.3. WAIT YOUR SELECTED WAITING PERIOD BEFORE TEMPORARY DISABILITY BENEFITS ARE PAID TO YOU
No benefit payment will be made for temporary disability claims during the waiting period and once the waiting period has ended and the benefit payments commence, no retrospective payments will be made in relation to the waiting period. In other words, the claim payments only commence after the expiration of the waiting period and will only be paid in respect of the period after the waiting period expires.
However, if you have selected the 7-day waiting period, benefit payments will be made retrospectively in certain instances. In this case, benefit payment amounts will be made retrospectively from day one of the illness or injury, provided the illness or injury has rendered you fully unable to perform your nominated occupation for at least seven consecutive calendar days. This is referred to as a retrospective payment, and it also applies to the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit. Retrospective payments will only be made in the following instances:
• You have undergone medical treatment, and are complying with prescribed medication, that renders you unable to work, or
• You have been hospitalised for a continuous period of at least 24 hours (excluding fertility procedures, organ donation and cosmetic procedures), or
• You have an infectious disease such as chicken pox or measles (gastro-enteritis and upper respiratory tract conditions such as common colds and influenza are excluded unless they require you to be hospitalised for a co

• You have undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Even if you have selected a 7-day waiting period, a one month waiting period will be applied to temporary disability claims arising from the following conditions:
• Fibromyalgia. Additionally, in order to qualify for a benefit payment after one month, a rheumatologist’s confirmation of the diagnosis and inability to work is required.
• Chronic fatigue syndrome. Additionally, in order to qualify for a benefit payment after one month, a specialist physician’s confirmation of the diagnosis and inability to work is required.
UNIQUE BENEFIT FOR CERTAIN PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE
If you are a professional (as defined in Appendix 13) in private practice or partnership, and you have chosen the one- month waiting period, benefit payment amounts will be calculated to include the time that you were temporarily disabled from the first day of the illness or injury, if the illness or injury has lasted at least 30 consecutive days. This is referred to as a retrospective payment, and it will only be made in the same instances as defined for the seven-day waiting period described above.

Content:  This is referred to as a retrospective payment, and it will only be made in the same instances as defined for the seven-day waiting period described above.
This benefit applies to the list of professionals in Appendix 13 in private practice/partnership, working in the selected occupation at the time of claim.
Discovery Life may review and amend this list of professionals from time to time.
7.15.4. WHEN DO MY INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT AND TOP-UP INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT PAYMENTS ON TEMPORARY DISABILITY END?
The Income Continuation Benefit pays out, as long as the benefit remains in force, until the earlier of:
• You having recovered sufficiently to return to work.
• The payment term of the underpin on which you are claiming expiring.
• The end of the month in which you turn 65.
• Your death.
The Top-up Income Continuation Benefit pays out, as long as the benefit remains in force, until the earlier of:
• You having recovered sufficiently to return to work.
• The payment term of the underpin on which you are claiming expiring.
• You receive 24 payments less your selected waiting period.
• You receive 24 payments less your selected waiting period for claims due to the same bodily injury or for the same or related condition, subject to necessary medical evidence as determined by Discovery Life. This limit will be waived for subsequent, related occupational disability claims, if your claim event has occurred at least 24 months after the maximum number of claim payments has been paid and you have been fully and continuously fulfilling the duties and responsibilities of your nominated occupation during this period.

7.15.6. HOW DOES THE CONTRIBUTION PROTECTOR WORK?
This benefit is automatically included in the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit. You will be entitled to the benefits of the Contribution Protector if you are claiming under any of the following definitions:
• Automatic Sickness Underpin
• Loss of Income Underpin
• LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit Underpin
• Injury and Hospitalisation Underpin.
Discovery Life’s Contribution Protector will pay up to 100% of all your premiums/contributions, which you were paying before the disability event for your Life Plan (excluding the premiums for the Income Continuation Benefit and the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit that are waived in full), Discovery Retirement Optimiser, qualifying health plans on participating medical schemes administered by Discovery Health, Discovery Insure, Medical Premium Waiver, Gap Cover, Supplementary Gap Cover, Global Education Protector, Vitality, Vitality Active, Vitality drive and Vitality Money.
In order for the Contribution Protector to pay out the contributions for a certain Discovery product, the life who suffered the disability must be the premium-payer as well as the life assured (for Discovery Life products), member (for Discovery Health products, Vitality, Vitality Active and Vitality drive), account holder (for Vitality Money) or driver (for Discovery Insure products) of that product at the time of the disability.
Please note:
• If you are both the premium-payer and life assured on more than one Life Plan, only the premiums attributable to the policy under which you are claiming for the Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit will be returned to you.
Page Number: 64

Content: 
Please note:
• If you are both the premium-payer and life assured on more than one Life Plan, only the premiums attributable to the policy under which you are claiming for the Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit will be returned to you.
• If you are both the premium-payer and driver on more than one Discovery Insure policy, only the premiums attributable to the policy with the highest premiums will be returned.
• Premiums for the Discovery Retirement Optimiser policy on your Life Plan will be returned to you. However, this only applies to Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies linked to the Life Plan under which you are claiming for the Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit.
Should you have insured less than 75% of your monthly income (100% of your income if you have also selected the Top-up Income Continuation Benefit), the Contribution Protector payout will be reduced proportionately. If you insure yourself at the maximum amount of Income Protection allowed and as a result are insured for less than 75% of your total monthly income, the Contribution Protector payout will not be reduced proportionately.
The Contribution Protector payment is determined based on your premiums/contributions being paid at the time of claim, including normal annual contribution increases. Only automatic annual contribution increases while in claim are taken into account.

Content:  Only automatic annual contribution increases while in claim are taken into account. Elective increases to premiums/contributions while in claim are not taken into account; however, decreases in premiums/contributions during claim will reduce the amount of this additional payment. The additional payment is subject to a maximum of 33% of the Income Continuation Benefit amount plus the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amount (if selected).
The benefit payment will cease on the earlier of:
• You returning to work (or recovering sufficiently, in the opinion of the medical panel of Discovery Life, to be able to return to work).
• Your disability meeting the Category A, B or D (if applicable to your occupation) definitions of disability reflected in Appendix 4 of the Individual Life Plan Guide.
• 24 monthly payments. If you recover or are rehabilitated before the full number of monthly payments has been made and claim again for the same cause within three months of recovery (the ‘off-period’), the subsequent claim will not be regarded as a new event and thus you will only qualify for the balance of the monthly payments that have not yet been made.
• The end of the applicable payment period, in the case of claims under the LifeTime Severe Illness Underpin or the Injury and Hospitalisation Underpin.
• You reach age 65.

7.16 WHAT HAPPENS IF I BECOME PERMANENTLY DISABLED BEFORE AGE 65?
This section explains the benefit payments made for permanent disability suffered prior to age 65.
7.16.1. HOW DO I QUALIFY FOR A PERMANENT DISABILITY CLAIM?
Your disability will be regarded as permanent if:
• Your disability meets the Category A definition of disability, as defined in Appendix 4; or
• Your disability meets the Category D definition (if applicable to your occupation), namely that it is established, to the satisfaction of Discovery Life, that you are totally and permanently unable to perform your nominated occupation (as indicated on your Policy Schedule) due to sickness, injury, disease or illness. Chronic fatigue syndrome (and any manifestations thereof) and fibromyalgia are excluded under Category D. Please note that Category D is not available to certain occupations. Please refer to your Policy Schedule to see if your occupation qualifies for Category D.
CAPITAL DISABILITY BENEFIT UNDERPIN
If you do not meet the Category A or D definitions above, you may still claim under the Capital Disability Benefit Underpin. This underpin pays 50% of your monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount for five years, if you suffer a Category B disability (as defined in Appendix 4). You will also receive 50% of your monthly Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amount for 24 months.

Content:  You will also receive 50% of your monthly Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amount for 24 months.
7.16.2. CAN I PROTECT MY FULL INCOME IF I AM PERMANENTLY DISABLED?
For the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit, if your disability meets either the Category A (as defined in Appendix 4) or Category D (if applicable to your occupation) definition of permanent disability, you will qualify for Discovery Life’s unique upgrade on permanent disability.
For the Essential Income Continuation Benefit, if your disability meets both the Category A (as defined in Appendix 4) and Category D (if applicable to your occupation) definitions of permanent disability, you will qualify for Discovery Life’s unique upgrade on permanent disability.
The monthly income received from your Income Continuation Benefit on permanent disability will immediately be increased to 100% of your monthly income last declared by you to Discovery Life as reflected on your Policy Schedule, increased from that date to the date of commencement of the claim payment by the applicable annual benefit escalation rate, if your benefit amount meets the following criteria:
• If you have selected a monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount of 40% or more of your monthly income on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit; or
• If you have selected a monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount of 75% of your monthly income on the Essential Income Continuation Benefit.
If you have selected a monthly Income Continuation Benefit of less than the amounts described above (as applicable), your monthly income received on your Income Continuation Benefit will immediately be increased to the following multiples of your monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount at the time of claim:
• 2.

Content: 
If you have selected a monthly Income Continuation Benefit of less than the amounts described above (as applicable), your monthly income received on your Income Continuation Benefit will immediately be increased to the following multiples of your monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount at the time of claim:
• 2.5 times on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit; or
• 1.333 times on the Essential Income Continuation Benefit.
This upgrade is further subject to Discovery Life’s Permanent Disability Maximum. This Permanent Disability Maximum is determined as follows:
The annual Permanent Disability Maximum level set by Discovery Life as at inception of your Income Continuation Benefit, increased from the benefit inception date to the date of commencement of the claim payment, by the annual benefit escalation rate applicable to your Income Continuation Benefit.
If you have been granted a concession to exceed any maximums, the amount payable on permanent disability will be your Income Continuation Benefit amount and the Permanent Disability Maximum will not apply.
If you have selected the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit, your Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amount may also pay out for up to 24 months on permanent disability (if applicable and subject to aggregation rules defined in Section 7.22.5).
The upgrade on permanent disability does not apply to the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit or to claims paid under the Capital.

7.16.4. WHEN DO MY INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT AND TOP-UP INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT PAYMENTS ON PERMANENT DISABILITY END?
The Income Continuation Benefit pays out, as long as the benefit remains in force, until the earlier of:
• You receiving payment for five years, if you are claiming under the Capital Disability Benefit Underpin.
• The end of the month in which you turn 65.
• Your death.

• You receive 24 payments.
• You receive 24 payments for claims due to the same bodily injury or for the same or related condition, subject to necessary medical evidence, as determined by Discovery Life.

7.16.6. HOW DOES THE PERFORMANCE BONUS PROTECTOR WORK?
The Performance Bonus Protector is an optional benefit that is only available on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit. If you become permanently disabled (as defined in section 7.16.1, excluding Category B disability), the Performance Bonus Protector provides you with an additional series of annual benefit payments, with the first benefit payment being made 12 months after the qualifying permanent disability event. The remaining payments will be made annually, every 12 months after the first payment is made. The Performance Bonus Protector will make five annual payments in total.
The Performance Bonus Protector Benefit payments will be based on the Performance Bonus Protector Benefit amount increased by any Annual Benefit Increases before the disability event or In-Claim Escalation increases once you are in claim, as selected on your Income Continuation Benefit.

Content: 
The Performance Bonus Protector Benefit payments will be based on the Performance Bonus Protector Benefit amount increased by any Annual Benefit Increases before the disability event or In-Claim Escalation increases once you are in claim, as selected on your Income Continuation Benefit. An additional premium will be paid for the Performance Bonus Protector Benefit, which will be paid until the age of 65.
The Performance Bonus Protector Benefit pays out, as long as the benefit remains in force, until the earlier of:
• You receiving five benefit payments.
• The end of the month in which you turn 65.
• Your death.
Your Performance Bonus Protector Benefit premium will be waived if you are temporarily or permanently disabled (as defined in sections 7.15 and 7.16 respectively) and your Income Continuation Benefit premiums are waived.
The Performance Bonus Protector will only be available to salaried employees. Please note that if you are no longer a salaried employee, you are required to inform Discovery Life. If this information is not disclosed to Discovery Life, then Discovery Life will be entitled to follow any of the procedures as described in section 15.1. Clients will also be required to provide proof of their net of tax bonuses received over the previous three years at claim stage.

Content: SECTION 7
The benefit amount payable for claims under the Performance Bonus Protector Benefit is subject to a minimum of:
• Your Performance Bonus Protector Benefit amount; and
• 120% of the maximum of:
– The net of tax bonus you received in the past year; and
– The average net of tax bonus you received in the past three years.
For the purposes of this benefit, bonus is defined as any additional income earned from your nominated occupation over and above your income as defined in Section 7.13, as reflected on your tax certificate.
EXAMPLE:
You have selected the Performance Bonus Protector benefit and have a Performance Bonus Protector sum assured of R100 000. You become permanently disabled and the disability event qualifies for a benefit payment under the Performance Bonus Protector.
You received the following net of tax bonuses in the previous three years (starting from the latest net of tax bonus): R50 000; R90 000; R100 000, where your bonus in the last year was the payment of R50 000. The Performance Bonus Protector benefit payment will therefore be the greater of the bonus you received in the last year and the average bonus you received in the last three years, multiplied by 120%. The benefit payment will be equal to R96 000 [120% x Max {R50 000, (R50 000 + R90 000 + R100 000) ÷ 3}].
Since the benefit does not exceed the maximum sum assured of R100 000 it will be paid in full.

Content: 
Since the benefit does not exceed the maximum sum assured of R100 000 it will be paid in full.
Please note that:
• All Category D claims for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Mental, Behavioural and lower back issues will be excluded for any claims pay-out under the Performance Bonus Protector Benefit.
• On permanent disability, the permanent upgrade will not be applied to the Bonus Protector sum assured.
7.17 WHAT HAPPENS IF I BECOME PERMANENTLY DISABLED AFTER AGE 65?
This section explains the benefit payments made for disability suffered after the end of the month in which you turn age 65.
7.17.1. HOW DO I QUALIFY FOR A POST-RETIREMENT DISABILITY CLAIM?
Your claims will be assessed according to post-retirement claims criteria (as per Appendix 12). Should you qualify for a claim, the monthly benefit payment will be based on your whole of life cover amount (as per section 7.17.2) and the payment percentage associated with your condition, where each condition is associated with a payment percentage of either 100%, 75% or 50% (as per Appendix 12). Should you meet multiple post-retirement claims criteria, your monthly payment will be based on the highest payment percentage for which you qualify.
If you are in claim for permanent disability when you reach the end of the month in which you turn 65 and you meet any of the post-retirement claims criteria, you will automatically qualify for whole of life payments based on the new insured amount and the payment percentage for which you qualify. In the event that your condition does not meet any of the post-retirement claims criteria at that the end of the month in which you turn 65, or if you are not in claim at that point, no claim will be payable at that time.

Content:  In the event that your condition does not meet any of the post-retirement claims criteria at that the end of the month in which you turn 65, or if you are not in claim at that point, no claim will be payable at that time.
Note that a 14 day survival period applies to post-retirement disability claims. This means that you will have to survive for at least 14 days following the applicable disability event in order to qualify for a benefit payment.
7.17.2. HOW MUCH OF MY INCOME CAN I PROTECT AFTER AGE 65?
At the end of the month in which you turn 65, your Income Continuation Benefit cover amount will be converted into Long-term Care cover. The amount that will convert is based on your waiting period as at the end of the month in which you turn 65, and the Income Continuation Benefit option you qualify for as per the following table:
<table><tr><th></th><th colSpan=2>PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT COVER AMOUNT THAT CONVERTS TO LONG-TERM CARE COVER</th></tr><tr><th>SELECTED WAITING PERIOD</th><th>COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT</th><th>ESSENTIAL INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFIT</th></tr><tr><td>Seven days</td><td>70%</td><td>50.75%</td></tr><tr><td>One month</td><td>50%</td><td>36.25%</td></tr><tr><td>Three months</td><td>35%</td><td>25.375%</td></tr><tr><td>Twelve months</td><td>20%</td><td>14.

Content: SECTION 7
Your monthly premium for the Income Continuation Benefit will remain the same at the point of your cover converting to Long-Term Care cover and will continue to increase with Annual Contribution increases. If you are in claim at age 65 your Income Continuation Benefit Cover Amount that converts will be your Income Continuation Benefit when your claim began increased with Annual Benefit Increases up to age 65.
Once you qualify for a claim, your Long-Term Care benefit will increase with your selected in-claim escalation rate from that point onwards.
EXAMPLE:
Consider a client that is about to reach age 65 with the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit and a one month waiting period. Suppose further that the client has declared an income of R60 000 per month and has insured R40 000 per month. At the end of the month in which the client turns age 65, the Income Continuation Benefit cover amount will convert to Long-Term Care cover. This means that the Income Continuation Benefit cover amount as at age 65 will be multiplied by 50%, giving the client whole of life cover of R20 000 (= R40 000 x 50%). If the client is in claim at this time, the claim will be reassessed according to the post-retirement claims criteria (as per Appendix 12). If the client qualifies for a claim, and the payment percentage associated with the claim condition is 50%, the client will be paid out R10 000 per month, increased with in-claim escalation, for the rest of their life.

Content:  If the client qualifies for a claim, and the payment percentage associated with the claim condition is 50%, the client will be paid out R10 000 per month, increased with in-claim escalation, for the rest of their life. If the client qualifies for a claim condition with a payment percentage of 100% at a later date, the payment will increase to R20 000 from the time of qualifying for a claim at the higher severity (increased with annual benefit increases).
Note that your Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit and Performance Bonus Protector (if selected) as well as the premiums for these benefits will fall away at the end of the month in which you turn 65.
All payments made will be subject to the Maximum Benefit Amount (Section 7.22.3).
If you are in claim for permanent disability at age 65 or you qualify for a permanent disability claim after age 65, you will receive a once-off lump sum equal to 12 times the monthly Long-term Care cover amount, in addition to the monthly benefit payments. For claims arising after age 65 this payment is only made if you survive for at least 14 days following the applicable disability event. The payment percentage associated with each condition will not be applied to this benefit amount and this benefit amount will not be included in the calculation of the Maximum Benefit Amount (Section 7.22.3).
7.17.3. THERE IS NO WAITING PERIOD FOR DISABILITY CLAIMS AFTER AGE 65

7.17.6. HOW DOES THE CONTRIBUTION PROTECTOR WORK?

You will not be able to extend your selected retirement age during the time that you are claiming for the Income Continuation Benefit.
The Contribution Protector amount will be limited as follows:
• Should you have insured less than 75% of your monthly income (100% of your income if you have also selected the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit) prior to the cover converting to whole of life cover (at the end of the month before you turn age 65), the payout will be reduced proportionately. If you insured yourself at the maximum amount of Income Protection allowed and as a result were insured for less than 75% of your total monthly income at that time, the Contribution Protector payout will not be reduced proportionately.

7.19 FAMILY PROTECTOR
The Family Protector Benefit is automatically included in the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit. This benefit will pay your Income Continuation Benefit amount and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amount (if applicable), increased by the applicable benefit escalation rate to the time of claim, for up to six months if your spouse or children suffer a severe illness (Severity A or B, as defined in Appendix 1). Claim payments will remain level and will not be increased by your benefit escalation rate or in-claim escalation rate while this benefit is being paid.
The Family Protector will also pay your Income Continuation Benefit amount and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amount (if applicable), increased by the applicable benefit escalation rate to the time of claim, for one month if your spouse dies.
A maximum of six monthly payouts for any related severe illness conditions or conditions in the same body system will apply. You may however claim for subsequent claims where the condition is unrelated to the previous claim and is in a different body system. Payments for severe illnesses will only be made if your spouse or child is alive at the time of payment. Payments will be made at the end of each month when claiming and will be paid pro rata for the month in which the spouse or child dies if death occurs before the end of the benefit payment period.
The waiting period does not apply to this benefit.

The waiting period does not apply to this benefit. A claim will be paid as soon as it has been approved, and irrespective of your chosen waiting period. These payments will also not be regarded as income received from a disability income/sickness benefit for aggregation purposes (see Section 7.22.5).
This benefit and all claim payments will expire on the earlier of:
• The end of the month in which you turn 65.
• Your death.
• If your spouse is older than you, both the spouse severe illness and spouse death benefits will expire at the end of the month in which your spouse turns age 65.
• For your child, the child severe illness criteria under the Family Protector expires at the end of the month in which your child turns 19.
The cover for your spouse and each child in the family is provided without medical underwriting, but excludes pre-existing medical conditions affecting your spouse or child that you or your spouse or child knew about or sought medical attention for at any time in the past or at the time of taking up the benefit.
A spouse is defined as a person who is the permanent life partner or spouse or civil union partner of a member in accordance with the Marriage Act, the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, or the Civil Union Act or the tenets of any religion. The child must be the biological child of the life assured or must have been legally adopted to qualify for a benefit payment.

7.20 MATERNITY PREMIUM WAIVER BENEFIT
The Maternity Premium Waiver Benefit is automatically included in the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit, with a waiting period of 7 days or 1 month, for females. If you give birth or adopt a child, we will waive your Discovery Life Plan premiums (excluding Discovery Retirement Optimiser, Vitality and Vitality Active premiums) for four months. You will need to provide a birth certificate or adoption papers in order to be able to claim under the Maternity Benefit. A maximum of two births/ adoptions will qualify for the Maternity Benefit per insured life.
Maternities or adoptions that occur within the first year of the Income Continuation Benefit’s inception will not qualify under the Maternity Benefit.
7.21 FACTORS AFFECTING THE BENEFIT AMOUNT PAYABLE BEFORE YOU CLAIM
7.21.1 BENEFIT ESCALATION RATE
Your Performance Bonus Protector, Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amounts will increase on each policy anniversary by the benefit escalation rate you chose. The benefit escalation rate will also apply during the waiting period. The same benefit escalation rate will apply to the Performance Bonus Protector, Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit.
This benefit escalation rate need not be the same as that selected for other benefits on your Life Plan.

Content: 
This benefit escalation rate need not be the same as that selected for other benefits on your Life Plan.
7.21.2 CAN I INCREASE MY MONTHLY INCOME BY MORE THAN THE BENEFIT ESCALATION RATE?
You may apply to Discovery Life to increase your Income Continuation Benefit and/or Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit amounts as well as your Performance Bonus Protector sum assured at any point in time. Granting these additional benefits will be subject to medical and financial underwriting (except if you are increasing your benefit through the Guaranteed Insurability Benefit), as well as the annual maximum benefit levels set by Discovery Life.
Any increase to your Income Continuation Benefit amount will be subject to Discovery’s Income Continuation Benefit maximum of 75% of your income, while any increase to your Top-up Income Continuation Benefit amount will be subject to Discovery’s Top-up Income Continuation Benefit maximum of 25% of your income. In addition, the increased Top-up Income Continuation Benefit amount plus your Income Continuation Benefit amount cannot exceed your total income. Changing your Income Continuation Benefit amount may also affect the upgrade you are entitled to on permanent disability (see Section 7.16.2).
Please note: Discovery Life will request confirmation of your income to determine the upgrade that you will qualify for in the event of a permanent disability claim.

7.22 FACTORS AFFECTING THE BENEFIT AMOUNT PAYABLE WHILE YOU ARE CLAIMING
7.22.1 IN-CLAIM ESCALATION RATE
Once your monthly income payments commence, your monthly Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit (if selected) will increase or remain level, depending on your chosen in-claim escalation rate. Your chosen in-claim escalation rate will also apply to Performance Bonus Protector payments on an annual basis.
You can choose for your payments to:
• Remain level, or
• Increase annually in line with inflation, subject to a maximum increase of 10% per year, or
• Increase annually at a rate of inflation plus 3%, subject to a maximum increase of 13% per year (this option is only available on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit).
These increases will be effective after each 12-month period of benefit payments. Discovery Life will use the CPI figure as released by Statistics South Africa three months before the in-claim escalation anniversary.
If you recover and your income payments are stopped, the Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit will change back to the amount that would have applied if no claim had been submitted. In other words, your benefit amounts will revert to the benefit amount that applied at the start of your claim payments, increased by any applicable benefit escalation rates for the duration that you were receiving payments.

7.22.2 PARTIAL PAYMENTS
If you are claiming under the Automatic Sickness Underpin and you are only partially booked off work due to injury or disability, your monthly payments (including, where applicable, your Income Continuation Benefit, Top-up Income Continuation Benefit, Contribution Protector and Overhead Expenses Benefit) will be reduced proportionately for the period during which you are booked off work. For example, if your doctor indicates in the Claim Declaration Form that you were booked off for half a day’s work, Discovery Life will pay 50% of your monthly payments. Discovery Life will determine the partial payment based on an eight hour working day.
The minimum payment will be 25% of your monthly Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit (if applicable). Amounts less than 25% will not qualify for payment. All partial payments are further subject to Discovery Life’s Maximum Benefit Amount on temporary disability (defined in Section 7.22.3) and aggregation rules (defined in Section 7.22.5).
These rules will also apply to claims for occupational disability after age 65.
7.22.3 MAXIMUM BENEFIT AMOUNT
If you are temporarily disabled, the benefit amount payable for claims under the Income Continuation Benefit is subject to a maximum of 75% of your pre-disability income. The benefit amount payable under the Top-up Income Continuation Benefit is subject to a maximum of 25% of your pre-disability income.

Content:  The benefit amount payable under the Top-up Income Continuation Benefit is subject to a maximum of 25% of your pre-disability income. Additionally, for the first 24 months after the disability event, the sum of the benefit amounts payable for the Income Continuation Benefit and the Top-up Income Continuation Benefit is subject to a maximum of 100% of your pre-disability income. These maximum benefit amounts also apply to the Family Protector.
Discovery Life will pay your claim after your selected waiting period, as defined in Section 7.14, has expired and provided that you meet the requirements for a claim.
If you are permanently disabled (before age 65), this maximum is 100% of your pre-disability income if you have selected the following Income Continuation Benefit amounts (as applicable):
• Greater than or equal to 40% of your income on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit; or
• Equal to 75% of your income on the Essential Income Continuation Benefit.
If you have selected an Income Continuation Benefit amount less than the amounts above, your benefit will be limited to the lower of your income and the sum of your Top-up Income Continuation Benefit amount (for the first two years of disability) and the following multiples of your monthly Income Continuation Benefit amount:
• 2.5 times on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit; or
• 1.

Content: 5 times on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit; or
• 1.333 times on the Essential Income Continuation Benefit.
Payments from the Contribution Protector and once-off lump sum benefit under Long-term Care are not included in the above calculations. Therefore, you will receive these benefit payments in addition to the payments received under the Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit. However, if your payments from the Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit (if applicable) are reduced, the payments from the Contribution Protector will be based on the reduced Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit (if applicable).
If you have selected the Performance Bonus Protector benefit and you become permanently disabled, you will be entitled to a total of five annual payments which are subject to a minimum of:
• Your Performance Bonus Protector Benefit amount; and
• 120% of the maximum of:
– The net of tax bonus you received in the past year; and
– The average net of tax bonus you received in the past three years.
Your selected Performance Bonus Protector, Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit amounts, payable in the event of your disability, are stated on your Policy Schedule.

Note:
You must notify Discovery Life if you start earning an income while a claim is in payment under the loss of income definition, Category D disability on the Comprehensive and Essential Income Continuation Benefits or Category A disability on the Essential Income Continuation Benefit. Should Discovery Life determine that we were not notified of this while a claim was in payment, Discovery Life may recover any amount that was paid in excess of the amount that would have been paid if you had notified us that you were earning an income.
Discovery Life will not reduce the benefit payments under the Loss of Income Underpin, Category D disability on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit or Category A and D disability on the Essential Income Continuation Benefit as a result of the following earnings:
• Interest
• Rent
• Dividends (however, dividends payable by a private company/close corporation of which you are the owner and in terms of which you actively participate in the management of the company will not be excluded)
• Earnings generated before disability but only received after disability

7.22.5 AGGREGATION OF INCOME RECEIVED FROM OTHER INCOME OR SICKNESS BENEFITS
If you receive disability income or sickness benefits from other policies and these benefits together with your claim amount (as defined in Section 7.22.4) exceed the maximum benefit adjustment as defined below, the payment made to you will be adjusted proportionately. This adjustment will only apply up to the end of the month in which you turn 65. The formula to calculate the adjusted payment is as follows:
[(claim amount)/(claim amount + benefit amounts from other disability income or sickness benefits)] x maximum benefit adjustment
The claim amount, referred to in the above formula, is defined in Section 7.22.4 above. The maximum benefit adjustment in the above formula is calculated as follows:
• On temporary disability:
– 100% of your pre-disability income in the first 24 months following your disability
– 75% of your pre-disability income thereafter.
• On permanent disability (up to age 65):
– 100% of your pre-disability income.
Finally, your payment will be subject to your Permanent Disability Maximum (as defined in Section 7.16.2), if you qualify for the upgrade on permanent disability.
If you claim under the LifeTime Severe Illness Benefit Underpin, the LifeTime Severity Upgrades applicable to your severe illness will only be applied to your benefit payment after your benefit amount has been aggregated with amounts received from other disability income or sickness benefits. This ensures that the LifeTime Severity Upgrades do not form part of the benefit amount that is aggregated.

Content:  This ensures that the LifeTime Severity Upgrades do not form part of the benefit amount that is aggregated.
7.22.6 YOU WILL RECEIVE THE HIGHEST PAYMENT
It is possible for you to meet more than one of the criteria for claims under the Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit. In these instances, Discovery Life will always pay the higher of the payments applicable to the definitions under which you claim, after your claim amount has been calculated (see Section 7.22.4) and aggregation has been applied (see Section 7.22.5).
7.23 OVERHEAD EXPENSES BENEFIT
7.23.1 CAN I RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL INCOME TO COVER MY MONTHLY BUSINESS OVERHEAD EXPENSES?
The Overhead Expenses Benefit pays you, or in the case of a business-owned policy, the business, a regular income should your share of the qualifying overhead expenses not be met as a result of your becoming fully or partially unable to follow your nominated occupation, due to injury or illness as indicated in the Policy Schedule. These monthly expenses must continue during the period of disability.
Your share of qualifying overhead expenses will be determined as follows:
• The normal running expenses of the business incurred by your carrying out your nominated occupation
• Less: your share of depreciation, capital repayments on any outstanding debt, lease payments where the lease is not an essential part of the business, the cost of stock or goods, professional and other fees incurred in the course of your business, drawing accounts, your salary or other earnings (including retirement funding contributions) or the salary or other earnings of any member of your family, or another assured member who is self-employed, as well as the portion of all other expenditure related to personal expenses rather than business expenses.

Note:
Should you not have correctly disclosed your share of qualifying overhead expenses to us at application stage or when you have effected changes to the policy, Discovery Life reserves the right to recoup any benefit overpayments as well as terminate the benefit with no further benefit payments.
The Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit does not apply to the Overhead Expenses Benefit.

If you have selected the seven-day waiting period, benefit payments may be made retrospectively from day one of the illness or injury, provided the illness or injury has lasted at least seven consecutive calendar days. Retrospective payments will only be made in certain instances. Please see Section 7.15 for the full set of circumstances under which we will make retrospective payments.
If you are a professional in private practice or partnership, and you have chosen the one-month waiting period, benefit payments will be made retrospectively from day one of the illness or injury, if the illness or injury has lasted at least 30 consecutive days. This retrospective payment will only be made in the same instances as defined for the seven- day waiting period described above. This benefit applies to the list of professionals in Appendix 13 in private practice/ partnership, working in the professional occupation at the time of claim. Discovery Life may review and amend this list from time to time.
In order to claim for the Overhead Expenses Benefit, you and your treating doctor will still be required to complete Discovery Life’s Overhead Expenses Benefit claims forms. Discovery Life reserves the right to request additional medical information.
The benefit amount payable for claims under the Overhead Expenses Benefit is subject to a maximum of 100% of the average amount of your share of qualifying overhead expenses incurred during the 12-month period before disability.

The benefit amount payable for claims under the Overhead Expenses Benefit is subject to a maximum of 100% of the average amount of your share of qualifying overhead expenses incurred during the 12-month period before disability. This is defined as your Overhead Expenses Benefit Maximum Benefit Amount. If your overheads are of a variable nature, Discovery Life may determine a period other than 12 months to calculate average monthly overheads. You have 90 days from the commencement of the benefit payments to prove your share of qualifying overhead expenses incurred over the last 12 months before disability. This is referred to as the evidence free period.
Should you not have correctly disclosed your share of qualifying overhead expenses to us during this evidence-free period, Discovery Life reserves the right to recoup any benefit overpayments.
Your benefit payment will not be reduced by income earned by your or your business during the period of disability. However, if you receive the same or similar benefits from other policies and these benefits together with the calculated claim amount for the Overhead Expenses Benefit above, exceed the Overhead Expenses Benefit Maximum Benefit Amount, payments made to you will be adjusted proportionately.
The formula to calculate the adjusted payment is as follows:
[claim amount for the Overhead Expenses Benefit/(claim amount for the Overhead Expenses Benefit + benefit amounts for the same or similar benefits under other policies)] x Overhead Expenses Benefit Maximum Benefit Amount
The benefit payments are also subject to Discovery Life’s maximum monthly benefit limits, which are determined as follows:

• The maximum monthly benefit limit set by Discovery Life as at inception of your Overhead Expenses Benefit, increased from the benefit inception date to the date of commencement of the claim payment, by the annual benefit escalation rate applicable to your Overhead Expenses Benefit.
Any Overhead Expenses Benefit income payments will be limited by whichever of the following events occurs first:
• You recover sufficiently to return to work.
• A two-year benefit payment period from commencement of monthly benefit payments. This two-year period is deemed to be continuous if you have returned to work for a period of less than one year.
• Your share of the business being sold or if the business is no longer a going concern.
• At the end of the month in which you turn 60, 65 or 70 (depending on the benefit expiry age you selected).

7.23.2 HOW DOES THE ‘ESCALATION IN CLAIM’ BENEFIT WORK?
Once your monthly income payments commence, your monthly Overhead Expenses Benefit (if selected) will increase or remain level, depending on your chosen in-claim escalation rate.
You can choose for your payments to:
• Remain level, or
• Increase annually in line with inflation, subject to a maximum increase of 10% per year.
These increases will be effective after each 12-month period of benefit payments. Discovery Life will use the CPI figure as released by Statistics South Africa three months before the in-claim escalation anniversary.
If you recover and your payments are stopped, the Overhead Expenses Benefit will change back to the amount that would have applied if no claim had been submitted. In other words, your benefit amounts will revert to the benefit amount that applied at the start of your claim payments, increased by any applicable benefit escalation rates for the duration that you were receiving payments.
7.24 TAXATION OF INCOME CONTINUATION BENEFITS AND PREMIUMS
This Section details the tax treatment of your premiums and benefit payments, in accordance with current tax practice.

• If you are not performing your nominated occupation for three consecutive months before your claim. Note that this requirement does not apply to clients who are on Sabbatical, or those who returned to work following a period of retrenchment, at the time of claim.
• If you fail to inform Discovery Life of a change in your occupation. We reserve the right to terminate your Income Continuation Benefit, Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit and Overhead Expenses Benefit if your new occupation would not normally be covered by your policy.
• On termination of your policy for any reason whatsoever.
• If you cancel your life cover. Your Life Fund needs to be active for you to continue receiving Income Continuation Benefit payments.
• If you are claiming under the Loss of Income Underpin or Category D (if applicable to your occupation) and you recover sufficiently to return to work (in the opinion of Discovery Life’s medical panel).

7.26 ARE THERE ANY OTHER REASONS WHY MY CLAIM COULD BE REFUSED?
Discovery Life reserves the right to refuse claims for Income Continuation Benefit, Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit and Overhead Expenses Benefit when the claims are a result of any of the following:
• Treatment/rehabilitation for alcohol or substance abuse
• Routine pregnancy, including maternity leave (complications of pregnancy will be covered provided they are confirmed by your treating gynaecologist). The first 30 days after the birth of a baby will be regarded as maternity leave regardless of the waiting period selected.
• All cosmetic procedures (reconstructive surgical procedures where a medical condition is present will be covered)
• Organ donation.
The above exclusions apply in addition to the terms and conditions stated in Section 16.
7.27 INCOME CONTINUATION FUND
7.27.1 HOW DOES THE INCOME CONTINUATION FUND WORK?
This benefit is only available on the Comprehensive Income Continuation Benefit i.e. if you have a Classic or Purple Life Plan. If your Life Plan is Health, Vitality or Active Integrated, you automatically receive the Default Income Continuation Fund, which pays out as ten equal annual instalments from the end of the month in which you turn 65. The Default Income Continuation Fund automatically contributes 10% of your Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit sums assured to your Income Continuation Fund at the start of each policy year until the policy year in which you turn age 65.

Content:  The Default Income Continuation Fund automatically contributes 10% of your Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit sums assured to your Income Continuation Fund at the start of each policy year until the policy year in which you turn age 65. Any increase in your Income Continuation Benefit and Top-up Income Continuation Benefit sums assured after the age of 56 will not be taken into account in calculating this benefit.
EXAMPLE:
If you have selected an Income Continuation Benefit amount of R15 000, R1 500 will be added to your Income Continuation Fund at the start of the year. If your Income Continuation Benefit sum assured increases to R16 000 in the second year, R1 600 will be added to your Income Continuation Fund at the start of the second year. This occurs at the start of each policy year until the policy year in which you turn age 65.
BUY-UP INCOME CONTINUATION FUND
You may add the Buy-up Income Continuation Fund to your policy, for an additional premium, if you qualify for the Default Income Continuation Fund and have selected a 7-day or 1-month Income Continuation Benefit waiting period. Under the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund, 90% of your Income Continuation Benefit and Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit sums assured will also be added to your Income Continuation Fund. This will happen at the start of each policy year for 20 years, or until the start of the policy year in which you turn age 65 if earlier.

Content:  This will happen at the start of each policy year for 20 years, or until the start of the policy year in which you turn age 65 if earlier. No amounts will be added to the fund when you are in claim. An additional premium will be paid for the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund.
EXAMPLE:
If you have selected an Income Continuation Benefit sum assured of R15 000 and add the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund, R13 500 will be added to your Income Continuation Fund at the start of the policy year. The R1 500 will be added through your Default Income Continuation Fund, as described in the above example, giving a total transferred amount into your Income Continuation Fund of R15 000 in your first year.
Your Income Continuation Fund will accumulate with contributions from your Default and Buy-up Income Continuation Funds, as well as increasing with the selected Annual Benefit Increase on your Income Continuation Benefit and an annual adjustment factor (described in section 7.27.2) up until age 65. Your accumulated Income Continuation Fund will be paid to you in ten equal tax free (under current tax practice) annual instalments (i.e. 10% of the fund at age 65 will be paid annually) starting at the end of the month in which you turn 65, provided that your policy and Income Continuation Benefit is still in force at the time of a benefit payment being made. No further growth will apply to the accumulated Income Continuation Fund once the benefit starts to be paid.

Content: SECTION 7
EXAMPLE:
At the end of the month in which you turn 65 (which is not the same date as your policy anniversary date), your Income Continuation Fund is equal to R1 000 000. You will receive a benefit payment of R100 000 at this time and R100 000 annually thereafter until ten benefit payments have been made.
The premiums for the Buy-up Income Continuation Fund will be paid for 20 years, or up to the end of the month in which you turn age 65 if earlier. Please note that the premium guarantees described in Section 4.8 do not apply to this benefit and the premium for this benefit may be annually reviewable in light of a significant difference between current experience and the assumptions used when pricing, and with due consideration to the general economic and regulatory environment.
7.27.2 HOW DOES THE INCOME CONTINUATION FUND ADJUST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?
The Income Continuation Fund will be adjusted at each policy anniversary by the selected Annual Benefit Increase on your Income Continuation Benefit (as described in section 2.2) and an Income Continuation Fund Adjustment factor up to and including age 65. The Income Continuation Fund adjustment factor is based on the Integrator type (as described in section 10) on your Life Plan as follows:
POLICIES THAT HAVE THE HEALTH INTEGRATOR
The annual cover adjustments are dependent on:
• Your Vitality Status three months before your policy anniversary. If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy
anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary.
Page Number: 78
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-276
Content:  If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy
anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary.
• Your Health Plan (for in-house schemes the equivalent Discovery Health Medical Scheme Plan is assumed) as at three months prior to your policy anniversary.
• The number of lives assured with benefits on your Life Plan.
• The health claims submitted on your health plan (see Appendix 14).
The annual fund adjustment percentages are shown in the Income Continuation Fund Adjustment Matrix on your Policy Schedule.
The calculation of the amount of health claims used to determine your annual cover adjustment percentage is specified in Appendix 14. Discovery Life may alter these matrices from time to time.
Should you cease to be a member of a qualifying medical scheme administered by Discovery Health before the end of the month in which the Income Continuation Fund adjustments cease, you will receive annual Income Continuation Fund adjustments based on the adjustments for policies that have the Vitality Integrator. Further a change in your health plan or the number of lives assured on your Life Plan will result in a different matrix being applied to your Life Plan at the following policy anniversary.
Should you cease to be a member of both a qualifying medical scheme administered by Discovery Health and a member of Vitality at the same time, you will receive annual Income Continuation Fund adjustments based on the adjustments for policies that have the Vitality Integrator.

Content: 
EXAMPLE:
At policy anniversary your Income Continuation Fund is equal to R100 000. Assuming you had an Income Continuation Fund adjustment factor of 1% based on a Gold Vitality Active Status and your chosen Annual Benefit Increase option is equal to inflation and inflation is equal to 5%, your Income Continuation Fund will increase to R106 000 (R100 000 x [1 + 5% + 1%]).
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
For all Integrator types, the Income Continuation Fund adjustments occur on each anniversary until the end of the month in which you turn 65. For policies that have the Active Integrator, if there are spouse benefits on the policy, the annual Income Continuation Fund adjustment factor will be based on the principal’s Vitality Active status.
For the Health and the Vitality Integrated policies, should you cease to be a member of Vitality before the end of the month in which your Income Continuation Fund adjustments cease, you will receive an Income Continuation Fund adjustment based on the Blue/ No Vitality status.

Content: 
For the Health and the Vitality Integrated policies, should you cease to be a member of Vitality before the end of the month in which your Income Continuation Fund adjustments cease, you will receive an Income Continuation Fund adjustment based on the Blue/ No Vitality status. Similarly, for Active Integrators, should you cease to be a member of Vitality Active before the end of the month in which your Income Continuation Fund adjustments cease, you will receive an Income Continuation Fund adjustment based on the Blue/No Vitality Active status.
Should you carry out servicing on your policy such that you no longer qualify for integration on your policy or switch to the Essential Income Continuation Benefit, both the Default Income Continuation Fund and the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund, if any, will be removed from your policy, without a return of premiums.
The total benefit payments from the Buy-up Income Continuation Fund have a minimum guaranteed value of 100% of all the premiums paid under this benefit over the 20 year period or up to age 65, if earlier. If at age 74 the sum of the premiums paid for this benefit (adjusted appropriately for any servicing alterations) are more than the sum of all the payments made from the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund throughout the policy term, then the difference between the premiums paid up to age 65 and the payments received from the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund will be refunded to you at the end of the month in which you turn age 74, without interest.
EXAMPLE:
If at age 74 you have paid R500 000 in Buy-up Income Continuation Fund premiums and you have received a total of R1 000 000 from Buy-up Income Continuation Fund payouts, then no additional payment will be made.

EXAMPLE:
If at age 74 you have paid R500 000 in Buy-up Income Continuation Fund premiums and you have received a total of R1 000 000 from Buy-up Income Continuation Fund payouts, then no additional payment will be made.
However, if at age 74 you have paid R1 100 000 in Buy-up Income Continuation Fund premiums and you have received a total of R1 000 000 in Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund payouts, then an additional payment of R100 000 will be made when you turn 74.
In the case of your death before the end of the month in which you would have turned 65, your beneficiaries or estate (as applicable) will receive a refund of 100% of your Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund premiums paid (without interest) if this benefit is still in force. In the case of your death between ages 65 and 74, if you have paid more in premiums for the Buy-up Income Continuation Fund than the amount you have received in payments from the Buy-up Income Continuation Fund at the point of death, Discovery Life will refund the excess premiums paid to your beneficiaries.

Content: SECTION 7
EXAMPLE:
Assume you receive a Buy-up Income Continuation Fund payout of R500 000 when you turn 65 and a second payout of R500 000 when you turn 66. Furthermore, assume that later in the year (still age 66), you have paid a total of R1 200 000 in Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund premiums (from the time that you took out the benefit until age 65).
In the case of your death at that point, a pay-out of R200 000 (R1 200 000 - R1 000 000) will be made to your beneficiaries.
If you electively reduce your Income Continuation Benefit sum assured or your Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit sum assured, your Income Continuation Fund will be reduced proportionally. No surrender value will be paid if you lapse the Income Continuation Benefit, Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund benefit or your Life Plan.
7.27.3 HOW DOES THE INCOME CONTINUATION FUND WORK WHEN YOU BECOME DISABLED?
If you become temporarily disabled (as defined in section 7.15), the Income Continuation Benefit as well as the Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit payments made to you will reduce your Default Income Continuation Fund. This will not occur on permanent disability events (as defined in section 7.16).
On temporary disability, benefit payments only reduce your Income Continuation Fund up to a maximum amount of the total contributions made to the Default Income Continuation Fund, plus any growth on those contributions. Thereafter, all payments will be made from Discovery Life.

================================================================================

Content:  Thereafter, all payments will be made from Discovery Life. Please note that the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund will not be reduced on any temporary or permanent claims.
EXAMPLE:
Assume you have selected a Classic Life Plan with the Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund. After 5 years, you have accumulated an Income Continuation Fund with a value of R100 000, comprising of R 10 000 resulting from contributions from your Default Income Continuation Fund and R 90 000 resulting from contributions from your Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund.
You suffer a temporary disability where you become unable to perform at least 25% of the main duties of your nominated occupation due to illness and as a result you are unable to maintain your income level and therefore claim under the Loss of Income Underpin. An Income Continuation Benefit payment of R15 000 is made to you. However because this amount is more than the R10 000 total contributions made to the Default Income Continuation Fund, your Default Income Continuation Fund will be reduced by R10 000 to zero. Your Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund will still have an accumulated value of R90 000.
Assume instead to date the composition of your R100 000 Income Continuation Fund is R35 000 resulting from contributions from your Default Income Continuation Fund and R 65 000 resulting from contributions from your Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund. You qualify for a benefit payment of R15 000 as a result of suffering temporary disability.

Content:  You qualify for a benefit payment of R15 000 as a result of suffering temporary disability. An Income Continuation Benefit of R15 000 is made to you. Because this amount is less than the R35 000 total contributions made by the Default Income Continuation Fund, your Default Income Continuation Fund is reduced by the full R15 000 to R20 000, and your Buy-up Income Continuation Fund still has a value of R65 000.
If you are temporarily or permanently disabled and receiving benefit payments under the Income Continuation Benefit, no additional amounts from your Income Continuation Benefit or Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit sums assured will be added to your Income Continuation Fund at anniversary. Your Income Continuation Fund will continue to be adjusted by the selected Annual Benefit Increase on your Income Continuation Benefit and the Income Continuation Fund adjustment factors (as defined in section 7.27.2).
If you or your spouse have claimed on either Severe Illness Benefit (Severity A or B), the Capital Disability Benefit (Category A, B or D) or the Income Continuation Benefit (permanent disability), the minimum Income Continuation Fund adjustment factor will be 0% after the claim. Positive adjustments will still apply for those clients who are highly engaged.
The minimum Income Continuation Fund adjustment factor of 0% will apply only from the policy anniversary after the qualifying claim has been finalised and completely processed by Discovery Life.

Content: 
The minimum Income Continuation Fund adjustment factor of 0% will apply only from the policy anniversary after the qualifying claim has been finalised and completely processed by Discovery Life. If a claim has been reported but not finalised at policy anniversary, the minimum will not be applied. This minimum will only apply while you are still a life assured on the policy and will fall away if the benefits on this policy are serviced in such a way that there is an increase in the policy premiums.
Please note that your Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund premiums will be waived if you are temporarily or permanently disabled and receiving benefit payments under the Income Continuation Benefit. Additionally, claims under the Income Continuation Benefit will not reduce your Income Continuation Fund after age 65.

Content: SECTION 8
ESTATE PLANNING BENEFIT
8.1 WHAT IS THE ESTATE PLANNING BENEFIT?
The Estate Planning Benefit provides a benefit payment to your nominated beneficiaries on the second death of you and your spouse. This benefit will not be affected by claims on any other benefits on the policy, and is also not linked to any Cover and Financial Integrator. The Managed Care Integrator is not applicable to this benefit.
On the death of the surviving spouse, the nominated beneficiaries on the policy will be paid an amount, as follows:
(i) Initial Estate Planning Benefit sum assured
Plus
(ii) Any amount by which your Estate Planning Benefit sum assured has changed at each policy anniversary due to applicable annual automatic benefit escalations (only applicable up to the time of the first death of you and your spouse)
Plus
(iii) Any other ad hoc increases or decreases made by you to your Estate Planning Benefit sum assured since the policy commenced
Less
(iv) Reductions to your Estate Planning Benefit sum assured as a result of an Estate Planning Benefit AccessCover claim.
EXAMPLE
A client and his spouse have an Estate Planning Benefit with a sum assured of R1 000 000. The spouse dies three years into the policy term. At this time, no benefit payment will be made and premiums will cease. The Estate Planning Benefit sum assured at this point has however increased to R1 250 000 due to annual benefit escalations.
Page Number: 81
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-287
Content:  The Estate Planning Benefit sum assured at this point has however increased to R1 250 000 due to annual benefit escalations.
The client (as the surviving spouse on the benefit) dies four years later. At this point, the Estate Planning Benefit sum assured of R1 250 000 will be paid to the client's nominated beneficiaries or estate as the case may be.
Any claim against the Estate Planning Benefit will not reduce the Life Fund. If after the first death of you or your spouse, the surviving spouse is diagnosed with a terminal illness and is deemed by the medical panel of Discovery Life (in their sole discretion) to have a survival period of 12 months or less, the full Estate Planning Benefit sum assured (less any AccessCover reductions, if applicable) will be paid out to the surviving spouse. No further benefit will be paid out on the death of the surviving spouse in this scenario.
Please note that the premium guarantees described in Section 4.8 do not apply to this benefit and the premium for this benefit may be annually reviewable in light of a significant difference between current experience and the assumptions used when pricing, and with due consideration to the general economic and regulatory environment.
8.2 ESTATE PLANNING PREMIUM WAIVER
On the first of your death or the death of your spouse, the Estate Planning Benefit premiums will no longer be payable. From this point onwards, the Estate Planning Benefit sum assured will lock in (i.

Content:  From this point onwards, the Estate Planning Benefit sum assured will lock in (i.e. will not increase by the elected annual benefit escalation rate going forward and no further servicing will be allowed on this benefit).
8.3 ESTATE PLANNING ACCESSCOVER BENEFIT
The Estate Planning Benefit AccessCover is automatically included in your Estate Planning Benefit, provided that you and your spouse meet certain underwriting and eligibility criteria.
QUALIFYING CRITERIA
• The surviving spouse is age 60 next birthday or older at the time of the first death.
• Both lives must have been younger than age 61 next birthday when the Estate Planning benefit is taken out.
• Neither of the lives may have any exclusions on their Estate Planning benefit.
These criteria are listed below and may change from time to time.

EXAMPLE
A client and his spouse have an Estate Planning Benefit with a sum assured of R1 000 000, of which the surviving spouse (aged 65 age next birthday) can convert up to R300 000 under the Estate Planning Benefit AccessCover Benefit.
After the death of the client, his spouse (aged 60 next at the time of the client's death) chooses to convert R200 000 of the Estate Planning Benefit sum assured into cash. The Estate Planning Benefit sum assured will reduce to R800 000 (R1 000 000 - R200 000) and the spouse will receive a payment of R200 000 x 0.25 = R50 000.
Two months thereafter, the spouse is diagnosed with a terminal illness and dies five months thereafter. In this scenario, Discovery Life will pay out the client's nominated beneficiaries R950 000 (R800 000 + R150 000).

Content: SECTION 9
GROWING YOUR LIFE FUND
9.1 WHAT FACTORS AFFECT THE GROWTH OF MY LIFE FUND?
The Life Fund can increase as a result of the following factors:
• Annual benefit escalation rate: you can choose for your Life Fund to increase annually at a selected benefit escalation rate as described in Section 2. This provides the potential for your Life Fund to keep up with South African inflation. The growth in your Life Fund will be calculated annually on the anniversary of your policy’s commencement.
• The Future Fund Benefit: you can significantly increase your Life Fund on an annual basis, subject to certain maximums, without evidence of health or insurability.
• The Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Fund provides you with the ability to add efficient risk cover.
• The Vitality Fund (only applicable to Purple Life Plans and Classic and Essential Life Plans with the Bank Integrator) provides you with additional life cover at no additional premium for a limited period.
• The Legacy Fund benefit (only applicable on qualifying Purple Life Plans) provides you with additional life cover at no additional premium upon meeting specified conditions.
9.2 HOW DOES THE FUTURE FUND BENEFIT WORK?
You have the right to increase your Life Fund without evidence of health or insurability, on each policy anniversary before the expiry age for this benefit.
This means that you nominate a Future Fund at inception of the policy.
Page Number: 83
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-292
Content: 
This means that you nominate a Future Fund at inception of the policy. The nominated Future Fund will increase on each policy anniversary by the Fund Increase Rate of 15%. Discovery Life will have the discretion to vary this rate.
To determine the amount by which you may increase your Life Fund at each policy anniversary, the nominated Future Fund increases at each policy anniversary by the Fund increase rate and is multiplied by the option rate. The option rate may vary at your discretion between 7.5% and 15% to increase your Life Fund with.
The total amount of additional Life Fund taken out in terms of this benefit, together with any automatic annual increases, may not exceed the original Future Fund selected for this benefit.
The additional cover purchased at each policy anniversary will be subject to the same rates, terms and conditions, but with the same exclusions, health, occupational and hazardous pursuit loadings, which apply to the original Life Fund. Should the smoker status, occupation or hazardous pursuits have changed between the date of purchasing the benefit and the date of exercising any option, loadings and exclusions will be based on the details relevant at the time of granting the option. In this case, Discovery Life has the right to alter or modify the benefit granted to you.
Discovery Life reserves the right to request the assured lives to undergo a test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibodies, before granting increased cover.

Discovery Life reserves the right to request the assured lives to undergo a test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibodies, before granting increased cover. If any of the assured lives test HIV-positive, Discovery Life has the right to modify or cancel this benefit.
The Future Fund Benefit will expire on the earliest of the following:
• reaching the end of the month you turn your chosen expiry age.
• the date on which more than 36 months have lapsed since cover was last increased through this benefit.
• the date on which premiums for this benefit cease.
• the date when the maximum additional cover for this benefit has been reached.
If a claim for any of the Severe Illness, Family or Capital Disability Benefits arises, where the claim was assessed according to a Severity level of A, B, C or D for the Severe Illness or Family Benefits and Category A, B or D (if applicable to your occupation) for the Capital Disability Benefit, future options to increase the Life Fund will provide additional life cover only for the life to whom the claim was related. However, the Future Fund benefits for other assured lives on the Life Plan will remain unchanged.
Options to increase the Capital Disability Benefit will not be granted should a claim under the Capital Disability Benefit (Category C), the Income Continuation Benefit or any other disability benefit have been made within three years of the option date.
Should the claim be assessed according to Severity levels E, F or G for the Severe Illness or Family Benefits, there will be no change to the Future Fund benefit for all the assured lives.

The policyholder may increase the Life Fund in the event of:
• marriage
• birth or adoption of a child
• increase in interest in a partnership
• increase in bond cover.
Following this event, you forfeit the right to increase your Life Fund at the next policy anniversary.
The Future Fund Benefit does not apply to the non-accelerated Capital Disability Benefit or the non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefit. It will not be possible to access any cover added by the Future Fund benefit through AccessCover or AccessCover Plus after claiming for a Medical AccessCover event.
Any cover bought through an exercise of the Future Fund benefit, will not increase your Vitality Fund (on Purple Life Plans and Classic and Essential Life Plans with the Bank Integrator), Legacy Fund (on Purple Life Plans) or Estate Planning benefit amounts.
Premium Waiver Benefits do not apply to the Future Fund Benefit.
9.3 THE COVER INTEGRATOR
9.3.1 HOW DOES THE COVER INTEGRATOR FUND WORK?
You may establish your Life Plan to include a Life Fund as well as an additional amount of protection through the Cover Integrator Fund. There are two options available:
Option 1: Initial Cover Integrator Fund equal to 20% of the Life Fund Option 2: Initial Cover Integrator Fund equal to 40% of the Life Fund
EXAMPLE
If you selected a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with the 20% Cover Integrator option, your initial total cover will amount to R1 200 000.
If you have selected the 20% Cover Integrator option, you may upgrade to the 40% Cover Integrator option.

Content: 
If you have selected the 20% Cover Integrator option, you may upgrade to the 40% Cover Integrator option. This is subject to the life assured undergoing medical underwriting, Discovery Life’s age limits and the Cover Integrator still being available to buy at the time. If you add the Financial Integrator Fund (section 9.4) together with Cover Integrator Fund, the sum of the selected Financial Integrator Fund percentage and the selected Cover Integrator Fund percentage is limited to 60% of your Life Fund at the time of adding your Cover or Financial Integrator Fund.
The Cover Integrator operates in the same way as the Life Fund, except that the level of the Cover Integrator Fund is adjusted (in terms of the annual cover adjustment calculations described in section 9.3.2 below) on an annual basis based on whether you have Vitality Active, Vitality and a qualifying health plan on a participating medical scheme administered by Discovery Health (referred to as your Health Plan). In particular, the following features apply to the Cover Integrator Fund:
• The ancillary benefits defined as a percentage of the Life Fund will apply to the Cover Integrator Fund in the same percentages as they apply to the Life Fund. Benefit payments operate in the same way on your Cover Integrator Fund as on your Life Fund as defined in Section 2.4.
• Should you have selected the Health Integrator (section 10.

Content: 4.
• Should you have selected the Health Integrator (section 10.1), the Vitality Integrator (section 10.2), the Active Integrator (section 10.3), the Bank Integrator (Section 10.4) or the Managed Care Integrator (Section 10.5) on your Life Plan, the initial premium reduction, annual premium review and PayBack as defined in Section 10, will apply to the Cover Integrator premium as well. Please note that the five-yearly PayBack does not apply to any Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums (described in Section 9.3.5).
• If you qualify for Vitality Rating (Section 4.4), the Vitality Rating discount and/or Vitality Rating Longevity discount and adjustments will apply to the relevant Cover Integrator premiums.
• The automatic annual premium increase and automatic annual benefit increase selected on your Life Fund applies to the Cover Integrator Fund as well. The Cover Integrator Fund is only available on Life Plans which have automatic annual benefit increases, other than 0%. Should you change the automatic annual benefit increase to 0%, your Cover Integrator Fund will be removed.
• All Premium Waiver Benefits apply to the Cover Integrator premiums.
• The Cover Integrator Fund will be added to the non-accelerated Capital Disability and non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefits. If you have selected these benefits, they will be illustrated on your Policy Schedule.

Content: SECTION 9
9.3.2 HOW IS THE COVER ADJUSTED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?
In addition to your selected Annual Benefit Increase, annual cover adjustments (known as the Integrated Cover Adjustments) will be made to your Cover Integrator Fund. These adjustments are calculated on the sum of your Integrated Cover and your Life Fund immediately before policy anniversary.
The annual Integrated Cover Adjustment for the Cover Integrator Fund is calculated using the Cover Integrator Adjustment Matrix which depends on the Integrator type (as described in section 10) that applies to this policy. Please see the annual cover adjustments as per the Integrator type, below:
POLICIES THAT HAVE THE HEALTH INTEGRATOR
The annual cover adjustments are dependent on:
• The Cover Integrator option selected (20% or 40%)
• Your Vitality Status three months before your policy anniversary. If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary.
• Your Health Plan (for schemes administered by Discovery Health the equivalent Discovery Health Medical Scheme Plan is assumed) as at three months prior to your policy anniversary
• The number of lives assured with benefits on your Life Plan
• The health claims submitted on your Health Plan (see Appendix 14).
The above annual cover adjustment percentages are shown in the Cover Integrator Adjustment Matrix on your Policy Schedule.

Content: SECTION 9
EXAMPLE
If you have selected a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with the 20% Integrated Cover option, your initial cover will amount to R1 200 000. Assuming you had a Silver Vitality Active status, your annual Integrated Cover adjustment will be 0.12% as per your Cover Integrator Adjustment Matrix. Your Total Life Fund (increased by your selected annual benefit increase in your second year) will be adjusted according to the Integrated Cover Adjustment of 0.12% (ie R1 200 000 x 0.12% = R1 440).
Assuming your annual benefit increase is 6.5%, your Life Fund in your second year will amount to R1 065 000 (R1 000 000 + annual benefit increase [R1 000 000 x 6.5% = R65 000]) and your Integrated Cover in your second year will amount to R214 440 (R200 000 + annual benefit increase + Integrated Cover Adjustment = R200 000 + R13 000 [R200 000 x 6.5%] + R1 440 [R1 200 000 x 0.12%]).
If you had spouse benefits on your policy, and your spouse’s Vitality Active status was Blue, your annual Integrated Cover adjustment will change from 0.12% to the average of your and your spouse’s annual Integrated Cover adjustment, which is -0.115% (1/2 x (principal’s annual Integrated Cover adjustment + spouse’s annual Integrated Cover adjustment) = 1/2 x (0.12% - 0.35%).
ALL POLICIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE HEALTH INTEGRATOR OR THE ACTIVE INTEGRATOR
The annual cover adjustment percentage depends on:
• The Cover Integrator option selected (20% or 40%)
• Your Vitality status three months before your policy anniversary.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
For all Integrator types, the adjustments occur on each anniversary until the end of the month in which you turn 65, if the cover was electively added before your 56th birthday. If cover was electively added after your 56th birthday the adjustments above will cease at the end of month in which you turn 10 years older than the age you were when that cover was electively added. The benefit requirements specify that the Cover Integrator Fund must run until you turn 65 or a minimum of 10 years after the cover was electively added, whichever is later, in order for the above mentioned adjustments to cease.

Content:  The benefit requirements specify that the Cover Integrator Fund must run until you turn 65 or a minimum of 10 years after the cover was electively added, whichever is later, in order for the above mentioned adjustments to cease. Different portions of your Cover Integrator may have the adjustments cease at different points in time depending on when each portion of that cover was electively added.
EXAMPLE
If you have selected a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with the 20% Integrated Cover option, your initial cover will amount to R1 200 000.
Assuming you had an annual Integrated Cover adjustment of -0.175% as per your Cover Integrator Adjustment Matrix, your Total Life Fund (increased by your selected annual benefit increase in your second year) will be adjusted according to the Integrated Cover Adjustment of -0.175% (ie R1 200 000 x -0.175% = -R2 100).
Assuming your annual benefit increase is 6.5%, your Life Fund in your second year will amount to
R1 065 000 (R1 000 000 + annual benefit increase[R1 000 000 x 6.5% = R65 000]) and your Integrated Cover in your second year will amount to R210 900 (R200 000 + annual benefit increase + Integrated Cover Adjustment = R200 000 + R13 000 (R200 000 x 6.5%) - R2 100 (R1 200 000 x -0.175%).
The Integrated Cover Adjustments will not reduce the Integrated Cover below the Minimum Protected Cover Level of 40% of the initial Integrated Cover (including automatic Annual Benefit Increases).

Content: 175%).
The Integrated Cover Adjustments will not reduce the Integrated Cover below the Minimum Protected Cover Level of 40% of the initial Integrated Cover (including automatic Annual Benefit Increases). Should the Integrated Cover level reach the Minimum Protected Cover Level, this level of cover can remain for whole of life, increasing by the selected annual benefit escalations.

Content: SECTION 9
As is shown in the Cover Integrator Adjustment Matrices, you may earn additional Integrated Cover depending on your Vitality status, Health claims and Vitality Active status (as applicable to your Integrator package). The maximum additional Integrated Cover that may be earned is 7.5% of the Life Fund (including Annual Benefit Increases) on the 20% Integrated Cover option and 15% of the Life Fund (including Annual Benefit Increases) on the 40% Integrated Cover option. Furthermore, should you attain the maximum additional Integrated Cover that may be earned, this level of cover can remain for whole of life, increasing by the selected annual benefit escalations.
Furthermore, for the Health, Vitality, Bank Integrators and Managed Care Integrator, as well as for Non-Integrated policies, should you cease to be a member of Vitality before the end of the month in which your Integrated Cover Adjustments cease, you will receive an annual cover adjustment based on the Blue/No Vitality status as per the tables shown at the beginning of this section. Similarly, for Active Integrators, should you cease to be a member of Vitality Active before the end of the month in which your Integrated Cover Adjustments cease, you will receive an annual cover adjustment based on the Blue Vitality Active status as per the tables shown at the beginning of this section.

Content: 
9.3.3 CAN YOU BUY BACK COVER LOST THROUGH THE INTEGRATED COVER ADJUSTMENTS?
You may apply to buy back amounts of Integrated Cover on each policy anniversary to the value of any Integrated cover adjustments that decreased your Cover Integrator over the previous year, attributable to the annual Integrated Cover Adjustments.
If you choose not to take up this option in any year, you may take it up at any of the next six policy anniversaries.
The buy back is subject to the following conditions:
• This option is only available if the benefit inception of the Cover Integrator Fund is before the life assured’s 56th birthday.
• You may buy back the full Integrated Cover Adjustment within three years of the adjustment being applied.
• If you don’t use this option to buy back the full Integrated Cover Adjustment within three years of the adjustment being applied, it may be used to buy back 50% of the adjustment on the 4th, 5th, or 6th policy anniversary after the adjustment has been applied.
• If any six-year period passes without you buying back any Integrated Cover Adjustment as described above, the right to exercise this option at any future time (in respect of any year’s Integrated Cover Adjustment) is forfeited.
• You may only buy back the Integrated Cover Adjustments at a policy anniversary.
• The ability to exercise any options and buy-back lost cover will expire at the end of the month in which your Integrated Cover Adjustments cease.

Content: 
• The ability to exercise any options and buy-back lost cover will expire at the end of the month in which your Integrated Cover Adjustments cease.
If a claim for any of the Severe Illness Benefits or Family Benefits (at Severity Levels A, B, C or D) or the Capital Disability Benefit (at Claim Category levels A, B or D) arises, future options to increase your Integrated Cover for the life to whom the claim was related will apply only to the Life Fund (and not the ancillaries). Options for other lives assured on the policy remain unchanged, as long as they haven’t claimed for such severities or categories. Options to increase the Capital Disability Benefit will not be granted should a claim under the Capital Disability Benefit (Category C), the Income Continuation Benefit or any other disability benefit have been made within three years of the option date.
Any cover reinstated through the option to buy back any cover lost through Integrated Cover Adjustments after age 56 will not be taken into account when calculating the Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion (see Section 9.3.5).
9.3.4 WHAT HAPPENS TO THE COVER INTEGRATOR FUND WHEN YOUR INTEGRATED COVER ADJUSTMENTS CEASE?
After the Integrated Cover Adjustments cease (as per section 9.3.2), the Cover Integrator Fund and premiums for this cover will continue for whole of life, with no additional Integrated Cover Adjustments being applied.

Content: 3.2), the Cover Integrator Fund and premiums for this cover will continue for whole of life, with no additional Integrated Cover Adjustments being applied. This is known as the post- retirement Cover Integrator Fund and will grow by the selected annual benefit escalation rate as per your Policy Schedule.
9.3.5 COVER INTEGRATOR BUY-UP CASH CONVERSION
If you have a Classic, Essential or Purple Life Plan, you may apply for the Buy-up Cash Conversion Benefit, which provides you with tax-free lump sum benefit payments at specific future ages. The value of these payments are determined as a percentage of your Cover Integrator Fund. You can elect the Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion percentage to be either 50%, 100% or 200%.
Selecting the Buy-up Cash Conversion Benefit is subject to our maximum entry ages, your policy meeting specified ancillary benefit requirements and the benefit being available at the time. An additional premium will be paid for this benefit. The Buy- up Cash Conversion Benefit is not available on Active Integrated policies (and will be removed on policies that switch to the Active Integrator).
87
The Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion payments are based on your Cover Integrator Fund value at the end of the month in which you turn age 65. This Fund will be paid out to you in four equal instalments at the end of the months in which you turn ages 65, 69, 73 and 77 (with no allowance for increases – no Annual Benefit Increases or Annual Cover Adjustments after age 65) provided that your policy is still in force at the point in time.

Content:  He chooses the 200% Buy-up Cash Conversion option on his Cover Integrator Fund. Therefore, he qualifies for four payouts from his Buy-up Cash Conversion Fund, made at ages 65, 69, 73 and 77.
Assuming his Cover Integrator Fund was R2 000 000 at the end of the month in which he turns age 65, he will receive four payments of 50% of R2 000 000 at ages 65, 69, 73 and 77. This translates into R1 000 000 (50% x R2 000 000) at age 65, R1 000 000 at age 69, R1 000 000 at age 73 and R1 000 000 at age 77.
The premium for these additional Buy-up Cash Conversion options will continue to be paid until the end of the month in which you turn age 77. However the Buy-up Cash Conversion premium at the time will halve after each of the Buy-up Cash Conversion payments has been made at ages 65, 69 and 73. Each year this premium will continue to increase at the policy’s Annual Contribution Increase (as well as the additional annual premium adjustment, if applicable – please see section 10). This benefit is available on Classic, Purple and Essential Life Plans, but it is not available on Plans that have the Active Integrator.
EXAMPLE
When you turn age 65, assume your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium is R1 000 per month. After you have received your first Buy-up Cash Conversion payout at age 65, your premium will halve to R500 per month. This will happen in the month following your 65th birthday.

Content:  This will happen in the month following your 65th birthday.
Each year this premium will continue to increase at the policy’s Annual Contribution increase (as well as the additional annual premium adjustment, depending on your Integrator package selected). Assuming your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium amounts to R750 at age 69, it will halve to R375 per month after the payout is made at the end of the month in which you turn 69. Your premium will halve again when you turn 73. These premiums will cease at the end of the month in which you turn age 77.
If the Cover Integrator cover is electively increased after age 56, the Buy-up Cash Conversion payable will not increase. The full Buy-up Cash Conversion percentage chosen will still be paid on all cover electively added prior to age 56.
The total Buy-up Cash Conversion Benefit payouts have a minimum guaranteed value of 100% of all the premiums paid under this benefit up to age 77. If at age 77 the sum of the premiums paid for this benefit (adjusted appropriately for any servicing alterations) are more than the sum of all the Buy-up Cash Conversion payments made to you throughout the policy term, then the difference between the premiums paid and the Buy-up Cash Conversion payments received will be refunded to you at the end of the month in which you turn age 77, without interest. Should you reduce your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium, your guaranteed minimum benefit will reduce proportionately.

Content:  Should you reduce your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium, your guaranteed minimum benefit will reduce proportionately.
EXAMPLE
If at age 77 you have paid R500 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums and you have received a total of R1 000 000 from Buy-up Cash Conversion payouts, then no additional payment will be made.
However, if at age 77 you have paid R1 100 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums and you have received a total of R1 000 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion payouts, then an additional payment of R100 000 will be made when you turn 77.

Content: SECTION 9
In the case of your death before the end of the month in which you would have turned 65, your beneficiaries or estate will receive a refund of 100% of your Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums paid (without interest) if this benefit is still in force. In the case of your death between ages 65 and 77, if you have paid more in premiums for the Buy-up Cash Conversion than the amount you have received in payments from the Buy-up Cash Conversion at the point of death, Discovery Life will refund the excess premiums paid to your beneficiaries. Should you reduce your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium before age 77, your policy value on death will be reduced proportionately.
Please note, that if you increase your Cover Integrator Fund after the date that the Buy-up Cash Conversion was selected on the policy, any resulting increases in the Buy-up Cash Conversion will be at Discovery Life’s discretion.
EXAMPLE
Assume you receive a Buy-up Cash Conversion payout of R500 000 when you turn 65 and a second payout of R500 000 when you turn 69. Furthermore assume that at age 72, you have paid a total of R1 200 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums (from the time that you took out the benefit until age 72).
In the case of your death at age 72, a pay-out of R200 000 (R1 200 000 - R1 000 000) will be made to your beneficiaries.
There is no surrender value for the Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion.

There is no surrender value for the Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion. As a result, no surrender value is paid if you lapse or cancel the benefit or your Discovery Life Plan before the payout dates.
The 200% Buy-up Cash Conversion option has certain qualifying criteria and therefore by reducing or removing benefits on your policy you may no longer qualify for the 200% Buy-up Cash Conversion option after the change. In this case your benefit and premium will be adjusted to the 100% Buy-up Cash Conversion option, as will be shown on the servicing quotation. Furthermore, there will be no refund of Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums in this scenario.
If your Cover Integrator Fund is reduced due to servicing or claims, any subsequent Buy-up Cash Conversion payments will be reduced proportionately to the percentage reduction in the Cover Integrator Fund. For scenarios when your Cover Integrator Fund is reduced due to a claim event, your Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums will also reduce going forward.
EXAMPLE
Assume you have a Life Fund of R1 000 000 and have selected the 20% Cover Integrator Fund Option. Therefore your Cover Integrator Fund amounts to R200 000 and as a result, your Total Life Fund (your Life Fund plus your Cover Integrator Fund) amounts to R1 200 000 at inception. Furthermore, assume you select a 50% accelerated Severe Illness Benefit, which gives you severe illness cover of R600 000 (R1 200 000 x 50%).

Content:  Furthermore, assume you select a 50% accelerated Severe Illness Benefit, which gives you severe illness cover of R600 000 (R1 200 000 x 50%).
If you claim for a Severity A Severe Illness Benefit condition, your payout would be R600 000 (100% of R600 000) and your Life Fund would halve and reduce from R1 000 000 to R500 000. Accordingly, your Cover Integrator Fund would also halve, from R200 000 to R100 000.
This 50% reduction in your Cover Integrator Fund would mean that all future payouts from this Fund would be halved. This will also halve any payouts from your Buy-up Cash Conversion Fund.
Please note, Discovery Life guarantees that the Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums for the Cover Integrator will not be increased for the first 10 years, except for any contractual premium increases. In addition, Discovery Life guarantees that if any premium increases are required at the end of the first 10 years and any 10-year period thereafter, these increases will not exceed 25% of your premiums being paid at that time.
9.4 THE FINANCIAL INTEGRATOR
9.4.1 HOW DOES THE FINANCIAL INTEGRATOR FUND WORK?
You may establish your Life Plan to include a Life Fund as well as an additional amount of protection through the Financial Integrator Fund. There are two options available:
Option 1: Initial Financial Integrator Fund equal to 20% of the Life Fund
Option 2: Initial Financial Integrator Fund equal to 40% of the Life Fund.

Content:  There are two options available:
Option 1: Initial Financial Integrator Fund equal to 20% of the Life Fund
Option 2: Initial Financial Integrator Fund equal to 40% of the Life Fund.
EXAMPLE
If you selected a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with the 20% Financial Integrator Fund Option, your total initial cover will amount to R1 200 000.

Content: SECTION 9
If you have selected the 20% Financial Integrator Option, you may upgrade to the 40% Financial Integrator Option. This is subject to the life assured undergoing medical underwriting, Discovery’s age limits and the Financial Integrator still being available to buy at the time.
If you add the Cover Integrator Fund (section 9.3) together with Financial Integrator Fund, the sum of the selected Financial Integrator Fund percentage and the selected Cover Integrator Fund percentage is limited to 60% of your Life Fund at the time of adding your Cover or Financial Integrator Fund.
The Financial Integrator operates in the same way as the Life Fund, except that the level of the Financial Integrator Fund is adjusted (in terms of the annual cover adjustment calculations described in section 9.4.2) on an annual basis based on whether you have Vitality Active, Vitality and a qualifying health plan on a participating medical scheme administered by Discovery Health (referred to as your Health Plan).In particular, the following features apply to the Financial Integrator Fund:
• The ancillary benefits defined as a percentage of the Life Fund will apply to the Financial Integrator Fund in the same percentages as they apply to the Life Fund. Benefit payments operate in the same way on your Financial Integrator Fund as on your Life Fund as defined in Section 2.

Content:  Benefit payments operate in the same way on your Financial Integrator Fund as on your Life Fund as defined in Section 2.4 of the Life Plan Guide.
• Should you have selected the Health Integrator (section 10.1), the Vitality Integrator (section 10.2), the Active Integrator (section 10.3), the Bank Integrator (section 10.4) or the Managed Care Integrator (Section 10.5) on your Life Plan, the initial premium reduction, annual premium review and PayBack as defined in Section 10 of the Life Plan Guide, will apply to the Financial Integrator premium as well. Please note that the five-yearly PayBack does not apply to any Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums (section 9.4.3).
• If you qualify for Vitality Rating (Section 4.4), the Vitality Rating discount and/or Vitality Rating Longevity discount and adjustments will apply to the relevant Financial Integrator premiums.
• The automatic annual premium increase and automatic annual benefit increase selected on your Life Fund applies to the Financial Integrator Fund as well. The Financial Integrator Fund is only available on Life Plans which have automatic annual benefit increases, other than 0%. Should you change your automatic annual benefit increase to 0%, your Financial Integrator Fund will be removed.
• All Premium Waiver Benefits apply to the Financial Integrator premiums.

Content: 
• All Premium Waiver Benefits apply to the Financial Integrator premiums.
• The Financial Integrator Fund will be added to the non-accelerated Capital Disability and non-accelerated Severe Illness Benefits. If you have selected these benefits, they will be illustrated on your Policy Schedule.
• If you decrease your Life Fund or non-accelerated benefits, your Financial Integrator Fund will be reduced proportionately.
9.4.2 HOW IS THE FINANCIAL INTEGRATOR FUND ADJUSTED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?
In addition to your selected Annual Benefit Increase, annual cover adjustments (known as the Integrated Cover Adjustments) will be made to your Financial Integrator Fund. These adjustments are calculated on the sum of your Integrated Cover and your Life Fund immediately before policy anniversary.
The annual Integrated Cover Adjustment for the Financial Integrator Fund is calculated using the Financial Integrator Adjustment Matrix which depends on the Integrator type (as described in section 10) that applies to this policy. Please see the annual cover adjustments as per the Integrator type, below:
POLICIES THAT HAVE THE HEALTH INTEGRATOR
The annual cover adjustments are dependent on:
• The Financial Integrator option selected (20% or 40%).
• Your Vitality Status three months before your policy anniversary.

Content: 
• Your Vitality Status three months before your policy anniversary. If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary.
• Your Health Plan (For schemes administered by Discovery Health the equivalent Discovery Health Medical Scheme Plan is assumed) as at three months prior to your policy anniversary.
• The number of lives assured with benefits on your Life Plan.
• The health claims submitted on your Health Plan (see Appendix 14).
The above annual cover adjustment percentages are shown in the Financial Integrator Adjustment Matrix on your Policy Schedule.
The calculation of the amount of health claims used to determine your annual cover adjustment percentage is specified in Appendix 14.
Discovery Life may alter these matrices from time to time.

Content: 
Assuming you had a Silver Vitality Active status, your annual Integrated Cover adjustment will be 0.12% as per your Financial Integrator Adjustment Matrix. Your Total Life Fund (increased by your selected annual benefit increase in your second year) will be adjusted according to the Integrated Cover Adjustment of 0.12% (ie R1 200 000 x 0.12% = R1 440).
Assuming your annual benefit increase is 6.5%, your Life Fund in your second year will amount to R1 065 000 (R1 000 000 + annual benefit increase [R1 000 000 x 6.5% = R65 000]) and your Financial Integrator in your second year will amount to R214 440 (R200 000 + annual benefit increase + Integrated Cover Adjustment = R200 000 + R13 000 [R200 000 x 6.5%] + R1 440 [R1 200 000 x 0.12%]).
If you had spouse benefits on your policy, and your spouse’s Vitality Active status was Blue, your annual Integrated Cover adjustment will change from 0.12% to the average of your and spouse’s annual Integrated Cover adjustment, which is -0.115% (1/2 x [principal’s annual Integrated Cover adjustment + spouse’s annual Integrated Cover adjustment] = 1/2 x [0.12% - 0.35%]).
ALL POLICIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE HEALTH INTEGRATOR OR THE ACTIVE INTEGRATOR
The annual cover adjustment percentage depends on:
• The Financial Integrator option selected (20% or 40%)
• Your Vitality Status three months before your policy anniversary. If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary.

For all Integrator packages, the adjustments occur on each anniversary until the end of the month in which you turn 65 if the cover was electively added before your 56th birthday.

were when that cover was electively added. The benefit requirements specify that the Financial Integrator Fund must run until you turn 65 or a minimum of 10 years after the cover was electively added, whichever is later, in order for the above mentioned adjustments to cease. Different portions of your Financial Integrator may have the adjustments cease at different points in time depending on when each portion of that cover was electively added.
EXAMPLE
If you have selected a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with the 20% Integrated Financial option, your initial cover will amount to R1 200 000.
Assuming you had an annual Integrated Cover adjustment of -0.175% as per your Financial Integrator Adjustment Matrix, your Total Life Fund (increased by your selected annual benefit increase in your second year) will be adjusted according to the Integrated Cover Adjustment of -0.175% (ie R1 200 000 x -0.175% = -R2 100).
Assuming your annual benefit increase is 6.5%, your Life Fund in your second year will amount to R1 065 000 (R1 000 000 + annual benefit increase[R1 000 000 x 6.5% = R65 000]) and your Integrated Cover in your second year will amount to R210 900 (R200 000 + annual benefit increase + Integrated Cover Adjustment = R200 000 + R13 000 (R200 000 x 6.5%) – R2 100 (R1 200 000 x -0.175%).
The Financial Integrator Cover Adjustments will not reduce the Financial Integrator Fund below the Minimum Protected Cover Level of 40% of the initial Financial Integrator Fund (including automatic annual benefit increases).

Content: 5%) – R2 100 (R1 200 000 x -0.175%).
The Financial Integrator Cover Adjustments will not reduce the Financial Integrator Fund below the Minimum Protected Cover Level of 40% of the initial Financial Integrator Fund (including automatic annual benefit increases). Should the Financial Integrator Fund level reach the Minimum Protected Cover Level, this level of cover can remain for whole of life, increasing by the selected annual benefit escalations.
As is shown in the Financial Integrator Adjustment Matrices, you may earn additional Integrated Cover depending on your Vitality status, Health claims and Vitality Active status (as applicable to your Integrator package). The maximum additional Integrated Cover that may be earned is 7.5% of the Life Fund (including Annual Benefit Increases) on the 20% Financial Integrator option and 15% of the Life Fund (including Annual Benefit Increases) on the 40% Financial Integrator option. Furthermore, should you attain the maximum additional Integrated Cover that may be earned, this level of cover can remain for whole of life, increasing by the selected annual benefit escalations.
Furthermore, for the Health, Vitality, Bank Integrators and Managed Care Integrator, as well as for Non-Integrated policies, should you cease to be a member of Vitality before the end of the month in which your Integrated Cover Adjustments cease, you will receive an annual cover adjustment based on the Blue/No Vitality status as per the tables shown at the beginning of this section. Similarly, for Active Integrators, should you cease to be a member of Vitality Active before the end of the month in which your Integrated Cover Adjustments cease, you will receive an annual cover adjustment based on the Blue/No Vitality Active status as per the tables shown at the beginning of this section.

9.4.3 CAN YOU BUY BACK COVER LOST THROUGH THE FINANCIAL INTEGRATOR ADJUSTMENTS?
You may apply to buy back amounts of Integrated Cover on each policy anniversary to the value of any integrated cover adjustments that decreased your Financial Integrator Fund over the previous year.
If you choose not to take up this option in any year, you may take it up at any of the next six policy anniversaries. This buy back is subject to the following conditions:
• This option is only available if benefit inception of the Financial Integrator Fund is before your 56th birthday.
• You may buy back the full Financial Integrator Adjustment within three years of the adjustment being applied.
• If this option to buy back the full Financial Integrator Adjustment is not used within three years of the adjustment being applied, you may use this option to buy back 50% of the adjustment on the 4th, 5th, or 6th policy anniversary after the adjustment has been applied. If any six-year period passes without you buying back any Financial Integrator Adjustment as described above, the right to exercise this option at any future time (in respect of any year’s Financial Integrator Adjustment) is forfeited.

Content:  If any six-year period passes without you buying back any Financial Integrator Adjustment as described above, the right to exercise this option at any future time (in respect of any year’s Financial Integrator Adjustment) is forfeited.
• You may only buy back the Financial Integrator Adjustments at policy anniversary.
• The ability to exercise any options and to buy back lost cover will expire at the end of the month in which your Financial Integrator Adjustments cease.
If a claim for any of the Severe Illness Benefits or Family Benefits (at Severity Levels A, B, C or D) or the Capital Disability Benefit (at Claim Category levels A, B or D) arises, future options to increase your Financial Integrator Fund for the life to whom the claim was related will apply only to the Life Fund (and not the ancillaries). Options for other lives assured on the policy remain unchanged, as long as they haven’t claimed for such severities or categories.

Content: SECTION 9
Options to increase the Capital Disability Benefit will not be granted if a claim under the Capital Disability Benefit (Category C), the Income Continuation Benefit or any other disability benefit has been made within three years of the option date.
Any cover reinstated through the option to buy back any cover lost through Integrated Cover Adjustments after age 56 will not be taken into account when calculating the Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion.
9.4.4 WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FINANCIAL INTEGRATOR FUND WHEN YOUR INTEGRATED COVER ADJUSTMENTS CEASE?
After the Integrated Cover Adjustments cease (as per section 9.4.2), the Financial Integrator Fund and premiums for this cover will continue for whole of life, with no additional Integrated Cover Adjustments being applied. This is known as the post-retirement Financial Integrator Fund and will grow by the selected annual benefit escalation rate as per your Policy Schedule.
9.4.5 FINANCIAL INTEGRATOR BUY-UP CASH CONVERSION
If you have a Classic, Essential or Purple Life Plan, you may apply for the Buy-up Cash Conversion Benefit, which provides you with tax-free lump sum benefit payments at specific future ages. The value of these payments are determined as a percentage of your Financial Integrator Fund. You can elect the Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion percentage to be either 50%, 100% or 200%.

Content:  You can elect the Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion percentage to be either 50%, 100% or 200%.
Selecting the Buy-up Cash Conversion Benefit is subject to our maximum entry ages, your policy meeting specified ancillary benefit requirements and the benefits being available at the time, at Discovery Life’s discretion.
An additional premium will be paid for this benefit. The Buy-up Cash Conversion Benefit is not available on Active Integrated policies (and will be removed on policies that switch to the Active Integrator).
The Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion payments are based on your Financial Integrator Fund at the end of the month in which you turn age 65. This fund will be paid out to you in four equal instalments at the end of the months in which you turn ages 65, 69, 73 and 77 (with no allowance for increases – no Annual Benefit Increases or Annual Cover Adjustments after age 65) provided that your policy is still in force at the point in time. These payouts will not reduce the risk cover provided by the Financial Integrator Fund. Additionally, the payouts will be made at the end of the month in which you turn the applicable age. Note that the payouts will be as per the amounts shown in your Policy Schedule. The payout as a percentage of the Financial Integrator Fund may not be equal to the Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion percentage you selected depending on the servicing you have done on your policy.

Assuming his Financial Integrator Fund was R2 000 000 at the end of the month in which he turns age 65, he will receive four payments of 50% of R2 000 000 at ages 65, 69, 73 and 77. This translates into R1 000 000 (50% x R2 000 000) at age 65, R1 000 000 at age 69, R1 000 000 at age 73 and R1 000 000 at age 77.
93
The premium for these additional Buy-up Cash Conversion options will continue to be paid until the end of the month in which you turn age 77. However, the Buy-up Cash Conversion premium at the time will halve after each of the Buy-up Cash Conversion payments has been made at ages 65, 69 and 73. Each year this premium will continue to increase at the policy’s Annual Contribution Increase (as well as the additional annual premium adjustment, if applicable – please see section 10). This benefit is available on Classic, Purple and Essential Life Plans, but it is not available on Plans that have the Active Integrator.

Content: SECTION 9
EXAMPLE
When you turn age 65, assume your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium is R1 000 per month. After you have received your first Buy-up Cash Conversion payout at age 65, your premium will halve to R500 per month. This will happen in the month following your 65th birthday.
Each year this premium will continue to increase at the policy’s Annual Contribution increase (as well as the additional annual premium adjustment, depending on your Integrator package selected). Assuming your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium amounts to R750 at age 69, it will halve to R375 per month after the payout is made at the end of the month in which you turn 69. Your premium will halve again when you turn 73.
These premiums will cease at the end of the month in which you turn age 77.
If the Financial Integrator cover is electively increased after age 56, the Buy-up Cash Conversion payable will not increase. The full Buy-up Cash Conversion percentage chosen will still be paid on all cover electively added prior to age 56.
The total Buy-up Cash Conversion Benefit payouts have a minimum guaranteed value of 100% of all the premiums paid under this benefit up to age 77. If at age 77 the sum of the premiums paid for this benefit (adjusted appropriately for any servicing alterations) are more than the sum of all the Buy-up Cash Conversion payments made to you throughout the policy term, then the difference between the premiums paid and the Buy-up Cash Conversion payments received will be refunded to you at the end of the month if which you turn age 77, without interest. Should you reduce your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium, your guaranteed minimum benefit will reduce proportionately.

Content:  Should you reduce your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium, your guaranteed minimum benefit will reduce proportionately.
EXAMPLE
If at age 77 you have paid R500 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums and you have received a total of R1 000 000 from Buy-up Cash Conversion payouts, then no additional payment will be made.
However, if at age 77 you have paid R1 100 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums and you have received a total of R1 000 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion payouts, then an additional payment of R100 000 will be made when you turn 77.
In the case of your death before the end of the month in which you would have turned 65, your beneficiaries or estate will receive a refund of 100% of your Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums paid (without interest) if this benefit is still in force. In the case of your death between ages 65 and 77, if you have paid more in premiums for the Buy-up Cash Conversion benefit than the amount you have received in payments from the Buy-up Cash Conversion at the point of death, Discovery Life will refund the excess premiums paid. Should you reduce your Buy-up Cash Conversion premium before age 77, your policy value on death will be reduced proportionately.
Please note, that if you increase your Financial Integrator Fund after the date that the Buy-up Cash Conversion was selected on the policy, any resulting increases in the Buy-up Cash Conversion will be subject to Discovery Life’s discretion.

Furthermore assume that at age 72, you have paid a total of R1 200 000 in Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums (from the time that you took out the benefit until age 72). In the case of your death at age 72, a payout of R200 000 (R1 200 000 - R1 000 000) will be made to your beneficiaries.
There is no surrender value for the Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion. As a result, no surrender value is paid if you lapse or cancel the benefit or your Discovery Life Plan before the payout dates.
The 200% Buy-up Cash Conversion option has certain qualifying criteria and therefore by reducing or removing benefits on your policy you may no longer qualify for the 200% Buy-up Cash Conversion option after the change. In this case your benefit and premium will be adjusted to the 100% Buy-up Cash Conversion option, as will be shown on the servicing quotation. Furthermore, there will be no refund of Buy-Up Cash Conversion premiums in this scenario.
If your Financial Integrator Fund is reduced due to servicing or claims, any subsequent Buy-up Cash Conversion payments will be reduced proportionately to the percentage reduction in the Financial Integrator Fund. For scenarios when your Financial Integrator Fund is reduced due to a claim event, your Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums will also reduce going forward.

EXAMPLE
Assume you have a Life Fund of R1 000 000 and have selected the 20% Financial Integrator Fund option, therefore your Financial Integrator Fund amounts to R200 000 and as a result, your Total Life Fund (your Life Fund + your Financial Integrator Fund) amounts to R1 200 000 at inception. Furthermore, assume you select a 50% accelerated Severe Illness Benefit, which gives you severe illness cover of R600 000 (R1 200 000 x 50%).
If you claim for a Severity A Severe Illness Benefit condition, your payout would be R600 000 (100% of R600 000) and your Life Fund would halve and reduce from R1 000 000 to R500 000. Accordingly, your Financial Integrator Fund would also halve from R200 000 to R100 000.
This 50% reduction in your Financial Integrator Fund would mean that all future payouts from this Fund would be halved. Note that this will also halve any payouts from your Buy-up Cash Conversion Fund.
Please note, Discovery Life guarantees that the Buy-up Cash Conversion premiums for the Financial Integrator will not be increased for the first 10 years, except for any contractual premium increases. In addition, Discovery Life guarantees that if any premium increases are required at the end of the first 10 years and any 10-year period thereafter, these increases will not exceed 25% of your premiums being paid at that time.

The Vitality Fund Benefit is available if you have a Purple Life Plan or if you have selected the Bank Integrator on your Classic or Essential Plan. The Vitality Fund Benefit provides additional, non-accelerated Life Cover for which a premium will only be charged after three years. The following additional periods of Vitality Fund cover could be available after three years:
• Two additional periods which are three years long on the Purple Life Plan; or
• One additional period for a further three years if you have selected the Bank Integrator on your Classic or Essential Plan.
The Vitality Fund is separate from the Life Fund on your Life Plan. If you have selected the Bank Integrator on a Purple Life Plan, then the rules below pertaining to the Purple Life Plan will supersede those of the Bank Integrator.
9.5.2 QUALIFYING CRITERIA FOR THE VITALITY FUND
• You must be the owner and principal life assured on your Life Plan.
• You must be younger than age 61 next birthday at the time of applying for the first period of the Vitality Fund. If you have a Purple Life Plan and you are older than age 56 next birthday at this time you may only be eligible for a total of two Vitality Fund periods of three years each.

Content: 
• You must have an A1 Risk Rating on all Life Cover benefits on your Life Plan at the onset of and during the existence of the benefit.
• Your Life Plan must at all times satisfy the requirements for Comprehensive Integration;
• Your Vitality membership must be in force at the onset of the benefit. If you cancel your membership during the course of the benefit, you can choose to purchase the Vitality Fund cover at that point, free of underwriting, but no further Vitality Fund periods will be available.
• All exclusions imposed on the Life Cover benefit on your Life Plan will apply to the Vitality Fund Benefit.
• You may not have had the Vitality Fund before, on any other Life Plans on which you were the Life Assured or owner.
These criteria may change from time to time and may result in your losing access to future periods of Vitality Fund.

9.5.3 HOW DOES THE VITALITY FUND WORK?
First period of Vitality Fund cover
The Vitality Fund is initially calculated as 20% of the Life Fund (excluding any Cover and Financial Integrator amounts) at the time of qualifying for the benefit (subject to the maximums determined by Discovery from time to time). Your Vitality Fund benefits will increase annually at the selected annual benefit escalation rate on your Life Plan.
For a period of three years thereafter no premium will be charged for the Vitality Fund. On the expiration of the three year period, the Vitality Fund cover will convert, free of underwriting, to whole-of-life cover under the Vitality Fund Buy-up benefit. A premium will be charged for this cover which will be based on the new business rates for your age at that time. You will be notified in writing before your premiums commence.
These premiums will increase annually at rates consistent with the Life Cover premium increases on your Life Plan. The Vitality Fund Buy-Up benefit cover (on this and all subsequent periods) will increase annually at the selected annual benefit increase rate on your Life Fund.
Second period of Vitality Fund cover
At the point when the first period of Vitality Fund cover is converted to the Vitality Fund Buy-Up benefit, the second period of Vitality Fund cover will be made available.
This second period will be calculated as 20% of the Life Fund (excluding any Cover and Financial Integrator amounts and previous periods of Vitality Fund Cover) at the time of adding the second period of Vitality Fund cover to which the Annual Vitality Fund Adjustment percentages will be added or deducted as per the Vitality Fund Adjustment tables below (subject to the maximums determined by Discovery from time to time).

Content: 
This second period will be calculated as 20% of the Life Fund (excluding any Cover and Financial Integrator amounts and previous periods of Vitality Fund Cover) at the time of adding the second period of Vitality Fund cover to which the Annual Vitality Fund Adjustment percentages will be added or deducted as per the Vitality Fund Adjustment tables below (subject to the maximums determined by Discovery from time to time). For the next three years no premium will be charged for the additional cover added in the second Vitality Fund period. You will be notified in writing before your premiums commence.
On the expiration of the second Vitality Fund period, this Vitality Fund cover will also convert to the Vitality Fund Buy-Up benefit. A premium will be charged for the additional cover added in the second Vitality Fund period which will be based on new business rates for your age at that time.
Third period of Vitality Fund cover (only available if you have a Purple Life Plan)
At the point when you start paying a premium for the second period of Vitality Fund cover, the third and final period of Vitality Fund cover will be made available.
This additional cover will be calculated on the same basis as the second period above (subject to the maximums determined by Discovery from time to time).
On the expiration of the third Vitality Fund period, this Vitality Fund cover will also convert to the Vitality Fund By-Up benefit and a premium will be charged for the cover that has been added.

EXAMPLE
Suppose you take out a Purple Life Plan at age 40 next birthday with a Life Fund of R10 000 000 with no Cover or Financial Integrator (Annual Benefit Increases and Annual Contribution Increases are ignored in this example). At policy inception, you pay R2 000 for your Life Fund cover. Your policy meets all the qualification criteria for the Vitality Fund and it is activated on your policy. You will receive 20% x R10 000 000 = R2 000 000 Vitality Fund for the next three years, at no additional premium during this period.
At the end of the first three year period, a R500 premium is charged for the R2 000 000 Vitality Fund Buy-up cover going forward. By retaining the additional cover, you now unlock a second piece of additional cover in your Vitality Fund for the next three years. This new additional piece of cover is dependent on your Vitality Health Status at the end of each of the first three years. Suppose your Vitality Health Status in each of these years were as follows:
Year 1: Blue
Year 2: Blue
Year 3: Bronze
Therefore, the additional cover unlocked in the second period is
= (20% -2% -2% -1%) x Current base Life Fund at the end of the third year
= 15% x R10 000 000
= R1 500 000
At the end of the next three year period (i.e. the end of the sixth year), a R400 premium is charged for the R1 500 000 Vitality Fund Buy-up cover going forward.

Content: e. the end of the sixth year), a R400 premium is charged for the R1 500 000 Vitality Fund Buy-up cover going forward. By retaining the additional cover, you now unlock a third piece of additional Vitality Fund cover, for the next three years. This new additional piece of cover is dependent on your Vitality Health Status in each of the past six years. Suppose your Vitality Health Status in each of these years were as follows:
Year 1: Blue
Year 2: Blue
Year 3: Bronze
Year 4: Silver
Year 5: Silver
Year 6: Gold
Therefore, the additional cover unlocked in the third period is
= (20% -2% -2% -1% + 0% + 0% + 1%) x Current base Life Fund
= 16% x R10 000 000
= R1 600 000
At the end of the next three year period (end of the ninth year), a premium of R450 will be charged for the Vitality Fund Buy-up cover added in this period and no more Vitality Fund periods are unlocked going forward.
In total, you will have Life Cover of R15 100 000 (R10 000 000 + R2 000 000 + R1 500 000 + R1 600 000) and will pay a total premium of R3 350 (R2 000 + R500 + R400 + R450).

9.5.4 WHEN WILL THE VITALITY FUND BENEFIT FALL AWAY?
• If you choose to remove or reduce any Vitality Fund Buy-Up benefit you will forfeit the right to qualify for any further Vitality Fund periods.
• If your policy does not qualify for Vitality Fund anymore due to changes you make to your policy (see qualifying criteria above), all amounts of Vitality Fund not yet converted to the Vitality Fund Buy-Up benefit will irrevocably fall away including the Vitality Fund that is currently being offered at no additional premium. You will not be able to activate it on any policy in the future. Your servicing quotation will indicate whether the changes will result in you no longer qualifying for this benefit.
• If you claim for certain other benefits (see list below) on any of your Life Plans during any of the Vitality Fund periods, you will still receive the Vitality Fund Buy-Up benefit at the end of the three year period. However, no further Vitality Fund periods will be available on this Life Plan or any of your other Life Plans, if applicable. The claims included here are for the benefits provided in the list below:
– Severe Illness Benefit: Severities A to D for all conditions
– Severe Illness Benefit: Severities E to G for Cancer and Heart and Artery conditions
– Capital Disability: Categories A to D
– Income Continuation Benefit: Categories A and D
– Income Continuation Benefit: Claims longer than 6 months
– Income Continuation Benefit underpins (excluding fracture and hospitalisation)
– Medical AccessCover
– Terminal Illness.
• If you cancel your Vitality membership (or Vitality Money membership, if applicable), you will still have the opportunity to take up that particular period’s Vitality Fund benefit at the end of that period.

Content: 
• If you cancel your Vitality membership (or Vitality Money membership, if applicable), you will still have the opportunity to take up that particular period’s Vitality Fund benefit at the end of that period. However, no further Vitality Fund period will be available.
• If you initially qualified for the Vitality Fund benefit (i.e. you had an A1 risk rating) and you subsequently add a non-A1 rated tranche of Life Cover, you will still have the opportunity to take up that particular period’s Vitality Fund benefit at the end of that period at A1 rates. However, no further Vitality Fund periods will be available.
• If you cancel your Life Plan, the Vitality Fund will also be cancelled, even if you subsequently reinstate your Life Plan or take out a new Life Plan policy.
• If you increase your Life Fund this will result in an increase in the value of any Vitality Fund cover for which you are not currently paying a premium. However the full value of this cover will become premium paying three years after the period started, regardless of when you performed the servicing.
• If you claim such that your Life Fund is depleted, your spouse will be given the option to take up the Vitality Fund cover on a new policy (assuming all other qualification criteria are met).

9.6.3 HOW DOES THE LEGACY FUND WORK?
The Legacy Fund Benefit allows you to boost your life cover in retirement by engaging with Vitality.
The cover you receive will be calculated as 20% of the Life Fund (excluding any Cover and Financial Integrator amounts) to which the Annual Legacy Fund Adjustment percentages will be added or deducted as per the Legacy Fund Adjustment tables below (subject to the maximums and minimums which may be reviewed on an annual basis taking into account emerging experience as well as consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment). This cover percentage is then multiplied by an additional factor, based on your Vitality Rating Longevity class to determine your final Legacy Fund Benefit amount. This amount is subject to a maximum determined by Discovery from time to time and will be shown in your Policy Schedule.

Content:  This means your final Legacy Fund percentage is 19% (38% x 50%). At this point you will have the following cover amounts:
• Life Cover = R10 000 000
• Vitality Fund 1 = R2 000 000 (20% x R10 000 000)
• Vitality Fund 2 = R1 600 000 (16% x R10 000 000)
• Vitality Fund 3 = R1 800 000 (18% x R10 000 000)
• Legacy Fund = R1 900 000 (19% x R10 000 000)
The Legacy Fund will grow with benefit increases on each policy anniversary after it is awarded.
AccessCover and AccessCover Plus (if applicable) will apply to the extra cover received through the Legacy Fund.
9.6.4 WHEN WILL THE LEGACY FUND FALL AWAY?
• If you choose to remove or reduce any of your Vitality Fund periods you will forfeit the right to qualify for the Legacy Fund benefit.
• If your policy does not qualify for Legacy Fund anymore due to changes you make to your policy (see qualifying criteria above), the Legacy Fund benefit will irrevocably fall away. You will not be able to activate it on any policy in the future. Your servicing quotation will indicate whether the changes will result in you no longer qualifying for this benefit.
• If you claim for certain benefits (see list below) on any of your Life Plans prior to the Legacy Fund benefit being added, you will no longer qualify. The claims included here are for the benefits provided in the list below:
– Severe Illness Benefit: Severities A to D for all conditions
– Severe Illness Benefit: Severities E to G for Cancer and Heart and Artery conditions
– Capital Disability: Categories A to D
– Income Continuation Benefit: Categories A and D
– Income Continuation Benefit: Claims longer than 6 months
– Income Continuation Benefit underpins (excluding injury and hospitalisation)
– Medical AccessCover
– Terminal Illness.

Content: SECTION 9
You will not lose your Legacy Fund if a claim on any of these benefits occurs in the period in which the Legacy Fund is active.
• If you cancel your Vitality or Vitality Active membership (as applicable) you will no longer qualify.
• If you initially qualified for the Legacy Fund benefit (i.e. you had an A1 risk rating) and you subsequently add a non-A1 rated tranche of Life Cover, you will no longer qualify.
• If you cancel your Purple Life Plan, the Legacy Fund will also be cancelled, even if you subsequently reinstate your Purple Life Plan or take out a new Purple Life Plan.
• If you reduce your ancillary percentages to below the level where you qualify for the Comprehensive Integrator, the Legacy Fund will fall away.
• If you change your Purple Life Plan to an Essential, Smart or Classic Life Plan, or you perform elective down-servicing such that you no longer qualify for the Purple Life Plan, will no longer qualify for the Legacy Fund, and any cover already granted through this benefit will fall away.

INTEGRATORS
Discovery’s Integrator range consists of the Comprehensive Integrator and the Core Integrator. In order to qualify for the Comprehensive Integrator, your Life Plan must comprise of at least one of the following:
• At least one of the qualifying benefits listed below is defined as at least 50% of the Life Fund or the maximum allowed:
– Spouse Life Cover
– Capital Disability
– Comprehensive Severe Illness Benefit
– Child Protector Benefit
– Female Severe Illness
– Minimum Income Continuation Benefit of R10 000 per month.
OR
• At least two of the above qualifying benefits are defined as at least 30% of the Life Fund or the maximum allowed.
OR
• One of the above qualifying benefits is defined as at least 30% of the Life Fund plus a minimum Income Continuation Benefit of R7 500 per month.
These criteria may be changed from time to time.
If none of these criteria are met you will only be able to qualify for Core Integration. Both of these Integrators offer you a choice of mechanisms which give you the ability to control your premium increases and, in certain cases, to receive PayBack.
The four mechanisms are:
• the Health Integrator
• the Vitality Integrator
• the Active Integrator
• the Bank Integrator.
The Comprehensive Integrator offers higher upfront premium reductions than the Core Integrator and also offers PayBack on the Health, Vitality and Active Integrator on the Classic or Purple Life Plan, but the requirements to qualify for the Comprehensive Integrator are stricter.

The Comprehensive Integrator offers higher upfront premium reductions than the Core Integrator and also offers PayBack on the Health, Vitality and Active Integrator on the Classic or Purple Life Plan, but the requirements to qualify for the Comprehensive Integrator are stricter.
Should you choose to Integrate your Life Plan and you select certain qualifying ancillary benefits, you will qualify for the Comprehensive Integrator. Should your policy not meet the qualifying ancillary requirements, you will qualify for the Core Integrator.
Should you initially have qualified for the Comprehensive Integrator but your policy fails to meet these qualifying requirements during the policy term, except in the case where benefits have reached the benefit expiry age or where benefits have reduced due to a claim, Discovery Life will change the premium to the premium that would have been paid on a Core Integrator. By Integrating your Life Plan, you immediately get the benefits of Integration, such as the upfront premium discount. For this reason, you are unable to remove the Integrator from your Life Plan. This also applies if your Life Plan no longer meets the qualifying criteria for Integration, for example if you cancel your Vitality membership or your qualifying health plan (administered by Discovery Health).
Should you have selected the Health Integrator (Section 10.

Content: 
Should you have selected the Health Integrator (Section 10.1), the Vitality Integrator (Section 10.2), the Active Integrator (Section 10.3) or the Bank Integrator (Section 10.4) on your Life Plan, the initial premium reduction, annual review and PayBack, will apply to the Cover Integrator Fund and Financial Integrator Fund as well. Please note that the five-yearly PayBack does not apply to any Buy-up-Cash Conversion premium (described in Section 9). In addition to the above integrators, there is the Managed Care Integrator. The Managed Care Integrator is only offered to lives assured with specific medical conditions that have resulted in a health loading applied to their premium.
10.1 HEALTH INTEGRATOR
Policyholders may select the Health Integrator as long as the principal and spouse lives assured are members of the same qualifying health plan from a participating medical scheme administered by Discovery Health and the same Vitality. Your Policy Schedule will indicate if your health plan is a qualifying health plan. KeyCare and schemes administered by Discovery Health which are KeyCare equivalents are excluded.
10.1.1 INITIAL PREMIUM REDUCTION
The Life Plan initial premium is reduced, depending on the Life Plan Funding structure and the life assured’s Health Plan. For schemes administered by Discovery Health, the equivalent Discovery Health Medical Scheme Plan will be used.

10.1.2 ANNUAL PREMIUM REVIEW
On the policy anniversary of the Life Plan, the premiums for all benefits will increase as described in Section 4.1. In addition, the premiums for all benefits on your Life Plan (except Vitality, Vitality Active, the Discovery Retirement Optimiser, and Buy-up Income Continuation Fund) may increase or decrease annually on the policy anniversary by an additional percentage depending on the amount of all submitted claims on the life assured’s Health Plan and on his/her Vitality status (as at three months before your policy anniversary . If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary.). The calculations of the health claims used to determine your annual premium adjustment are specified in Appendix 14. The Personal Health Matrix shown on your Policy Schedule determines this additional percentage increase or decrease, which is applied multiplicatively to the automatic annual premium increase that you selected on your Life Plan.
EXAMPLE
For example, assume that your monthly premium is R500 and you have selected an automatic annual premium increase of 10% and that the applicable adjustment in your Personal Health Matrix is an increase of 1%. Then your premium adjustment will be: R500 x (1 + 10%) x (1 + 1%) = R555.
Page Number: 104
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-377
Content:  Then your premium adjustment will be: R500 x (1 + 10%) x (1 + 1%) = R555.50.
Please note that Discovery Life may adjust your Personal Health Matrix on an annual basis taking into account changes to qualifying health plans on participating medical schemes administered by Discovery Health and to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment.
Premium reductions attributable to your Personal Health Matrix (over the lifetime of the Life Plan) may never reduce the premium to a level below what the premium would have been on an equivalent Non-Integrated Life Plan less the applicable initial premium reduction detailed above. In other words, no discounts in addition to the initial Health Integrator discount will be possible.
Should any life assured (apart from the parents of the principal life or spouse) on the Life Plan cease to be a member of Vitality, the policy will remain on the Health Integrator and the additional annual premium increase percentage will be set at a fixed rate of 2.25% per year instead of using the Personal Health Matrix. Should either of the principal or spouse lives assured described above cease to be a member of the same qualifying Health Plan on a participating medical scheme administered by Discovery Health, the following will apply:
• In the event that the lives assured are all on the same Vitality policy, they will be moved to the Vitality Integrator. In this case, any positive or negative balance of the Health Integrator PayBack (described below) will be transferred to the Vitality Integrator PayBack.

Content:  In this case, any positive or negative balance of the Health Integrator PayBack (described below) will be transferred to the Vitality Integrator PayBack.
• If the principal life is the one that has cancelled the health plan and therefore has lost the Vitality membership that was linked to the Health Plan, we will add Vitality to the Life Plan and automatically move the Life Plan to the Vitality

Integrator. In this case, any positive or negative balance of the Health Integrator PayBack (described below) will be transferred to the Vitality Integrator PayBack.
• If the principal and spouse lives assured are not on the same Vitality policy, the additional annual premium increase percentage will be set at a fixed rate of 2.25% and the PayBack will be set to 0%. Any accumulated PayBack Fund will also fall away. In this instance, any additional cover added while the cover is in this defaulted state will not receive any additional Integrator discounts. If Vitality is later added to the Life Plan so that all lives assured are on the same Vitality policy, the Life Plan will be moved to a Vitality Integrator.
Should your Health Integrator plan lapse and should you purchase another Life plan at some future date, the initial premium reduction percentage on the new plan may be reduced by any increases that you had on your original policy as a result of the Personal Health Matrix.
However, if you or your spouse have claimed on either Severe Illness Benefit (Severity A or B) or the Capital Disability Benefit (Category A, B or D), the Health Integrator annual premium adjustment is limited to 0% after claim. Negative adjustments will still apply for those clients who are highly engaged, subject to the maximum Integration premium reduction specified above.
The Health Integrator annual premium adjustment is capped at 0% only from the policy anniversary after the qualifying claim has been finalised and completely processed by Discovery Life.

Content: 
The Health Integrator annual premium adjustment is capped at 0% only from the policy anniversary after the qualifying claim has been finalised and completely processed by Discovery Life. If a claim has been reported but not finalised at policy anniversary, the cap will not be applied. This cap will only apply while you are is still a life assured on the policy and will fall away if the benefits on this policy are serviced in such a way that there is an increase in the policy premiums.
10.1.3 THE HEALTH INTEGRATOR’S MAXIMUM PROTECTED PREMIUM
In addition to normal premium guarantees, Discovery Life guarantees the following on the Health Integrator:
• Irrespective of the life assured’s health claims and/or Vitality status, your reduced premium plus premium increases relating to the Personal Health Matrix on the Health Integrator will not exceed the Maximum Protected Premium.
• The Maximum Protected Premium is defined in terms of the Equivalent Non-Integrated Premium (NI). The Equivalent Non-Integrated Premium (NI) is the premium that would have applied on a Non-Integrated policy at the policy anniversary after automatic annual premium increases have been taken into account.
The tables below reflect this relationship (where the client is a member of a scheme administered by Discovery Health the equivalent Discovery Health Medical Scheme Plan will be assumed):

10.1.4 PAYBACK STRUCTURES AVAILABLE ON THE HEALTH INTEGRATOR (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC AND PURPLE LIFE PLANS)
WHAT PAYBACK STRUCTURES ARE AVAILABLE TO ME?
If you are a member of a qualifying Health Plan on a participating medical scheme administered by Discovery Health and a member of Vitality, you will benefit by receiving PayBacks from the Health Integrator. There are two PayBack structures available to you which determine how your PayBacks will be accumulated:
• The Five-yearly PayBack which vests every five years; and
• Annual Guaranteed PayBack which vests on an annual basis together with a Health Surplus PayBack Fund which vests every five years. This PayBack structure is only available if you have the Financial Integrator benefit on your policy.
In addition to the PayBack structures mentioned above you can select the Double PayBack Option which allows you to double your PayBack percentage (and your guarantee percentage, in the case of the Annual Guaranteed PayBack). If you select this option, each PayBack payment that was due on the PayBack structure you selected above will only vest five years later.
Please note that the PayBack will only be paid to the owner of the policy.
The payment of the PayBack will have no impact on your Life Fund.
HOW IS MY PAYBACK CALCULATED?
The value of your PayBack is determined by a percentage of all qualifying Classic or Purple Life Plan premiums used in the calculation of your PayBack at each policy anniversary.
Page Number: 106
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-384
Content: 
HOW IS MY PAYBACK CALCULATED?
The value of your PayBack is determined by a percentage of all qualifying Classic or Purple Life Plan premiums used in the calculation of your PayBack at each policy anniversary.
Only 70% of the following premiums will be used in calculating the PayBack:
• Income Continuation Benefit
• Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit
• Overhead Expenses Benefit
In addition, all premiums and contributions to the following benefits will be excluded when calculating the PayBack:
• Paid-up benefit
• Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion
• Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion
• Vitality
• Discovery Retirement Optimiser
• Premiums waived while the policy is in waiver status
• Global Education Protector
• Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund.
During the time that premiums are waived on the Life Plan as a result of the Premium Waiver Benefits on death, disability and severe illness or for any other reason, the PayBack Fund will not increase.
Regardless of the PayBack structure you qualify for and whether or not you take up the Double PayBack Option, any outstanding premiums will be deducted from the PayBack at the time that the PayBack is paid to you.
WHEN DOES MY PAYBACK EXPIRE?
The PayBacks from your Health Integrator will end on the first policy anniversary after you reach age 65, or 10 years after your PayBack benefit has started, if this is later.
If your PayBacks are due to expire at age 65 and you are in a position where you have less than five years between your last PayBack payment and turning age 65, you will still be eligible for a PayBack payment at that point.
Page Number: 106
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-385
Content: 
If your PayBacks are due to expire at age 65 and you are in a position where you have less than five years between your last PayBack payment and turning age 65, you will still be eligible for a PayBack payment at that point. The PayBack calculation will remain unchanged, but will only be based on your eligible premiums between the previous PayBack payment and turning age 65. You will only be eligible for this payment if your PayBack benefit began before you turned age 55.
The accumulation of PayBacks under each PayBack structure is described below:
THE FIVE-YEARLY PAYBACK
As a member of a participating Health Plan on a medical scheme administered by Discovery Health and a member of Vitality with the Comprehensive Health Integrator, you are eligible for the Five-Yearly PayBack from the Health Integrator.
The Five-Yearly PayBack accumulates a percentage of your qualifying Life Plan premiums in a fund over a five-year period. This fund vests at the end of the five year period. The PayBack percentage that is applied annually to each year’s qualifying premiums in a particular five-year period is determined by your Personal PayBack Matrix shown on your

Content: SECTION 10
Policy Schedule and is affected by your and your spouse’s claims on your Health Plan in that year and your Vitality status three months before your policy anniversary. If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary. The calculations of the health claims used to determine your PayBack percentage are specified in Appendix 14. Discovery Life may alter your Personal PayBack Matrix from time to time taking into account emerging experience with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment. Your Personal PayBack Matrix will depend on your Health Plan as at three months prior to your anniversary as well as whether your Life Plan has one or multiple lives assured. A change in your Health Plan or the number of lives assured on your Life Plan will result in a different matrix being applied to your Life Plan at the following policy anniversary.
The PayBack calculation works as follows:
• The percentage as per your Personal PayBack Matrix of each policy year’s qualifying premiums is accumulated over a five-year period.
• Any claims on the Life Plan (excluding the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus, claims for temporary disability on the Income Continuation Benefit and premium waiver benefit claims) occurring between the start of the five-year period and up to three months before the end of the period are deducted from the amount that has been calculated over the five-year period. This means that at the end of the first five year cycle, only the claims in the first 57 months since the PayBack benefit started will be considered.

================================================================================

Content:  This means that at the end of the first five year cycle, only the claims in the first 57 months since the PayBack benefit started will be considered. Thereafter, at the end of the second and subsequent five year cycles, the claims occurring in the preceding 60 months will be considered, but with a three month lag.
• If the end value is positive, this Fund will vest at the end of the five-year period.
• Any elective reductions to your Life Plan premiums at any point in a particular five-year period may also reduce your accumulated PayBack fund.
• If your policy is cancelled before the fund vests, any accumulated PayBack Fund will be forfeited.
EXAMPLE
Your policy is Health Integrated. You have a Comprehensive Health Plan. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the Five-Yearly PayBack:
In year one your calculated PayBack percentage is 20% based on your Vitality Status and your Health Plan claims. This PayBack percentage is applied to the R12 000 worth of qualifying premiums you paid over the year resulting in R2 400 (20% x R12 000) being accumulated in your PayBack Fund at the end of year one.
In year three your calculated PayBack percentage is 35% based on your Vitality Status and your Health Plan claims over the last year. This PayBack percentage is applied to the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums you paid over the year and a further R5 082 (35% x R14 520) is added to your accumulated PayBack Fund.

Content:  This PayBack percentage is applied to the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums you paid over the year and a further R5 082 (35% x R14 520) is added to your accumulated PayBack Fund. This brings the total accumulated PayBack fund at this point to R11 112.
At the end of year five, your calculated PayBack percentage is 42.5%. R7 467 (42.5% x R17 569) is added to your accumulated PayBack fund bringing the total accumulated PayBack fund to R25 367. The PayBack fund vests and you receive a payment of R25 367. Your accumulated PayBack fund resets to zero after you receive your payment.

You must keep the Health Integrator for the entire five-year period to qualify for the Five-Yearly PayBack at the end of that five-year period. Should you or any life insured on the policy cease to be a member of Vitality for any reason during the five-year period, your Five-Yearly PayBack will also cease and you will not be eligible for a PayBack at the end of the five-year period. This means that any existing PayBack Fund will also fall away. If you change your Life Plan from a Classic or Purple Life Plan to an Essential Life Plan, your PayBack will cease and no payment will be made at the end of the five-year period. If you change your Life Plan from an Essential Life Plan to a Classic Life or Purple Plan that qualifies for PayBack, your first PayBack payment will be made at the first policy anniversary that falls at least five years from the date of changing to the Classic or Purple Life Plan. If you reduce your monthly Life Plan premiums at any point during the five- year period, your total accumulated PayBack Fund to date may be reduced. Please see your servicing schedule for any implications that servicing reductions may have on your PayBack payable at the end of the five-year period.
ANNUAL GUARANTEED PAYBACK
If you have the Comprehensive Health Integrator and you have the Financial Integrator benefit you will be eligible for the Annual Guaranteed PayBack for the first 10 years on your policy.

ANNUAL GUARANTEED PAYBACK
If you have the Comprehensive Health Integrator and you have the Financial Integrator benefit you will be eligible for the Annual Guaranteed PayBack for the first 10 years on your policy. At the end of this initial 10 year period your PayBack accumulation will follow the structure for the Five-Yearly Payback, described in the previous section.
The Annual Guaranteed PayBack pays you a guaranteed percentage of your qualifying premiums at the end of every year over the initial 10 year period. With the Annual Guaranteed PayBack, Discovery Life guarantees a level of annual PayBack which will not vary with Health Plan claims or your Vitality status. You can choose to have your Annual PayBack paid to you immediately or you may defer the payment by five years and double your PayBack percentages by taking up the Double PayBack Option, described in the next section.
The guarantee under the Annual Guaranteed PayBack depends on your Health Plan at the anniversary when the PayBack is calculated. Please refer to your Policy Schedule to see the guarantee percentage that you qualify for.
If a higher PayBack percentage is calculated for a particular year based on your Vitality status and Health Plan claims (as discussed in the Five-Yearly PayBack section above), the difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed PayBack is accumulated in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund. The Health Surplus PayBack Fund is paid at the end of year 5 and year 10, and is reduced to zero when the fund is paid out.

Content:  The Health Surplus PayBack Fund is paid at the end of year 5 and year 10, and is reduced to zero when the fund is paid out. You can choose to have your Surplus PayBack Fund paid to you immediately or you may defer the payment and double your PayBack percentages by taking up the Double PayBack Option, described in the next section.
Any claims from your Life Plan will only reduce the Health Surplus PayBack Fund. After the first 10 years any claims from your Life Plan will reduce the full PayBack amount at five-yearly intervals.
A change to your policy in the Annual Guaranteed PayBack 10 year period will not result in a new 10 year term commencing for any part of your policy. The original Annual Guarantee PayBack period will still terminate 10 years after adding the Financial Integrator to your policy for the first time.
When you change your Health Plan, this may result in a different guarantee percentage being applied to your Annual Guaranteed PayBack. Discovery Life may also alter the Annual Guaranteed PayBack table shown in your Policy Schedule to remain relevant to changes to qualifying health plans on participating medical schemes administered by Discovery Health and to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment.

EXAMPLE
Your policy is Health Integrated. You have a Comprehensive Health Plan. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the Annual Guaranteed PayBack:
In year one the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 10%. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 10% of the R12 000 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year one and is paid at the end of year one (R1 200). The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 20% based on your Vitality Status and your Health Plan claims. The difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed Payback ([ 20% -10%] x R12 000 = R1 200) is accumulated in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund.
In year three the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 10%. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 10% of the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year three and is paid at the end of year three (R1 452). The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 35% based on your Vitality Status and your Health Plan claims. The difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed Payback ([35% -10%] x R14 520 = R3 630) is accumulated in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund.
At the end of year five, you are paid the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage over that year (10% x R17 569 = R1 757) as well as what has accumulated in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund (R18 041).

At the end of year five, you are paid the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage over that year (10% x R17 569 = R1 757) as well as what has accumulated in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund (R18 041). The accumulated Health Surplus PayBack Fund includes the difference between the Annual Guaranteed Payback and calculated PayBack for year five ([42.5%-10%] x R17 569 = R5 710).

DOUBLE PAYBACK OPTION
In addition to the PayBack structure you qualify for, as described above, you may choose to add the Double PayBack Option to your Life Plan. The Double PayBack Option results in a doubling of the PayBack percentage you qualify for, as well as a doubling of the guarantee percentage if you qualify for Annual Guaranteed PayBack, but will delay the payment of your PayBack by 5 years. For the Five-yearly PayBack this will result in your first PayBack payment being paid on your 10th policy anniversary with subsequent payments made every five years thereafter. For the Annual Guaranteed PayBack, annual guaranteed payments will be paid for ten years on each policy anniversary starting from your sixth policy anniversary.

Content:  For the Annual Guaranteed PayBack, annual guaranteed payments will be paid for ten years on each policy anniversary starting from your sixth policy anniversary. Your Surplus PayBack fund will be paid on your 10th and 15th policy anniversary respectively.
If you qualify for the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, your annual guaranteed PayBack payments will still be paid for 10 years. Thereafter your PayBack accumulation and payment will follow the structure described for the Five-Yearly PayBack with the Double PayBack Option, as described above.
The PayBack percentage you qualify for will depend on your and your spouse’s claims on your Health Plan in that year and your Vitality status three months before your policy anniversary. If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary. For the Annual Guaranteed PayBack the guarantee percentage will depend on your Health Plan at the anniversary when the PayBack is calculated. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the Personal

PayBack matrix, and if applicable, the guarantee percentage you qualify for.
EXAMPLE
Your policy is Health Integrated and you have the Financial Integrator benefit, which means that your PayBack accumulation will follow the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure. You have a Comprehensive Health Plan and you have selected the Double PayBack Option. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the payments under the Double PayBack Option:
In year one the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 10%. This is doubled to 20% since you have selected the Double PayBack Option. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 20% of the R12 000 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year one. This results in an Annual Payback of R2 400 (20% x R12 000). This PayBack will be paid at the end of your sixth policy year. The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 20% based on your Vitality Status and your Health Plan claims. Your PayBack percentage is doubled to 40%. The difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed Payback ([40% - 20%] x R12 000 = R2 400) is accumulated in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund.
In year three the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 20%. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 20% of the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year three (R2 904) and is paid at the end of year eight.

Content:  The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 20% of the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year three (R2 904) and is paid at the end of year eight. The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 70% based on your Vitality Status, your Health Plan claims and because you have taken up the Double PayBack Option. The difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed Payback ([70% -20%] x R14 520 = R7 260) is accumulated in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund.
At the end of year five, the Annual Guaranteed PayBack over that year is R3 514 (20% x R17 569 which will be paid at the end of year 10 and the accumulation in the Health Surplus PayBack Fund is R36 082. The accumulated Health Surplus PayBack Fund includes the difference between the Annual Guaranteed Payback and calculated PayBack for year five ([85%-20%] x R17 569 = R11 420). Assuming there were no claims on your Life Plan over the accumulation period, the accumulated Health Surplus PayBack Fund will be paid out at the end of year 10.
The profile of payments under the deferred PayBack structure for the first ten years of the policy is summarised in the table below:

EXAMPLE
Continuing with the example above, you pass away in the seventh year of your Life Plan. Your PayBack payment will be recalculated using the Guaranteed PayBack percentage and the Personal PayBack matrix that applies under the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure and your beneficiaries will receive the following payments:
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your second policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your seventh policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 320)
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your third policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your eighth policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 452)
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your fourth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your ninth policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 597)
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your fifth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your tenth policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 757)
• The Health Surplus PayBack fund which vested on your fifth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your 10th policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R18 041), and
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your sixth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your 11th policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 933)

Content:  You have the option of receiving your PayBack immediately rather than waiting until the end of the deferred period. If you choose to receive your PayBack immediately you will qualify for the PayBack payments described under the Five-yearly PayBack structure or the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, if you have the Financial Integrator benefit. Once you have decided to remove the Double PayBack Option from your Life Plan, all future PayBack payments will be paid as they vest under the Five-Yearly or Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, unless you opt into the Double PayBack Option again.
Opting in and out of the Double PayBack Option is subject to the following restrictions:
• You may only opt out of the Double PayBack Option twice. Opting out of the Double PayBack option can only happen during the first 10 years after qualifying for PayBacks.
• You may opt in to the Double PayBack option at any time during your policy lifetime.
Any PayBack payments or vested Health Surplus PayBack fund which had been deferred will be paid to you at your next policy anniversary after you have opted out of the Double PayBack Option, in addition to any annual PayBack payment, or vested Health Surplus PayBack Fund due at that time. These payments will not be doubled but will be calculated using the Personal PayBack matrices you qualified for under the Five-Yearly PayBack structure or the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, without the Double PayBack Option.

Content: SECTION 10
Please note that if you choose to opt out of the Double PayBack Option, your PayBack payment will be re-calculated on the Personal PayBack matrix applicable without the effect of the Double PayBack Option and any claims on the Life Plan (excluding the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus, claims for temporary disability on the Income Continuation Benefit and premium waiver benefit claims) in the five year accumulation period will reduce your PayBack payment. This may result in a lower, or possibly no PayBack payment remaining after claims have been deducted.
HOW DOES THE DOUBLE PAYBACK OPTION AFFECT THE PAYBACK EXPIRY?
The PayBack from your Health Integrator will still end when you reach age 65, or 10 years after your PayBack benefit started, if this is later. If you have taken up the Double PayBack Option your final PayBack payment will be paid five years after you reach PayBack expiry age.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The Double PayBack Option is subject to the following:
• Any claims on your Life Plan during the 5-year deferred period will not reduce the PayBack payment under the Double PayBack Option.
• Your Life Plan must remain in-force for the full deferred period. If you lapse your Life Plan during the deferred period you will forfeit any PayBack payments which you have deferred.
• If you perform servicing on your Life Plan during the deferred period in such a way that your premium reduces your PayBack payment under the Double PayBack Option may be reduced proportionately.

On the Life Plan policy anniversary, the premiums for all benefits will increase as described in Section 4.1.
In addition, the premiums for all benefits on your Life Plan (except Vitality, Vitality Active, the Discovery Retirement Optimiser, and Buy-up Income Continuation Fund) may increase or decrease annually on the policy anniversary by an additional percentage, depending on the life assured’s Vitality status as at policy anniversary. If the life assured’s Vitality Status at the time of the policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before the anniversary, we will use the Vitality Status at the policy anniversary. These additional annual increases/decreases are shown in the Vitality matrix as follows:

The additional percentage is applied multiplicatively to the automatic annual premium increase that you selected on your Life Plan.
EXAMPLE
Assume that your premium is R500 and you have selected an automatic annual premium increase of 10% and that you are on bronze Vitality status. Then your premium adjustment will be: R500 x (1 + 10%) x (1 + 1.5%) = R558.25.
Please note that Discovery Life may adjust your Vitality Matrix on an annual basis to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment.
Premium reductions attributable to your Vitality Matrix (over the lifetime of the Life Plan) may never reduce the premium to a level below what the premium would have been on an equivalent Non-Integrated Life Plan less the applicable initial premium reduction detailed above. In other words, no discounts in addition to the initial Vitality Integrator discount will be possible.
Should the principal or spouse on the Life Plan cease to be a member of the same Vitality policy, the additional annual premium increase percentage will be at a fixed rate of 2.25% per year instead of using the Vitality table above.

Content: 25% per year instead of using the Vitality table above. While the policy is in this default state, any additional cover added will not qualify for the Integrator discount.
Should your Vitality Integrator plan lapse and should you purchase another Life plan at some future date, the initial premium reduction percentage on the new plan may be reduced by any increases that you had on your original policy as a result of the Vitality Matrix.
However, if you or your spouse have claimed on either Severe Illness Benefit (Severity A or B) or the Capital Disability Benefit (Category A, B or D),the Vitality Integrator annual premium adjustment is limited to 0% after claim. Negative adjustments will still apply for those clients who are highly engaged, subject to the maximum Integration premium reduction detailed above.
The Vitality Integrator annual premium adjustment is capped at 0% only from the policy anniversary after the qualifying claim has been finalised and completely processed by Discovery Life. If a claim has been reported but not finalised at policy anniversary, the cap will not be applied. This cap will only apply while you are still a life assured on the policy and will fall away if the benefits on this policy are serviced in such a way that it results in an increased premium.
10.2.3 THE VITALITY INTEGRATOR’S MAXIMUM PROTECTED PREMIUM
In addition to normal premium guarantees, Discovery Life guarantees the following on the Vitality Integrator:
• Irrespective of the life assured’s Vitality status, your reduced premiums on the Vitality Integrator Plus any premium increases above any automatic annual increases will not exceed the Maximum Protected Premium.

10.2.4 PAYBACK STRUCTURES AVAILABLE ON THE VITALITY INTEGRATOR (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC AND PURPLE LIFE PLANS)
WHAT PAYBACK STRUCTURES ARE AVAILABLE TO ME?
As a member of Vitality with the Vitality Integrator, you will benefit by receiving PayBacks from the Vitality Integrator. There are two PayBack structures available to you which determine how your PayBacks will be accumulated:
• The Five-yearly PayBack which vests every five years; and
• Annual Guaranteed PayBack which vests on an annual basis together with a Surplus PayBack Fund which vests every five years. This PayBack structure is only available if you have the Financial Integrator benefit on your policy. In addition to the PayBack structures mentioned above you can select the Double PayBack Option which allows you to double your PayBack percentage (and your guarantee percentage, in the case of the Annual Guaranteed PayBacks). If you select this option, each PayBack payment that was due on the PayBack structure you selected above will only vest five years later.
The PayBack will only be paid to the owner of the policy.

Content: 
The PayBack will only be paid to the owner of the policy. The PayBack will have no impact on your Life Fund.
HOW IS MY PAYBACK CALCULATED?
The value of your PayBack is determined by a percentage of all qualifying Classic or Purple Life Plan premiums used in the calculation of your PayBack at each policy anniversary.
Only 70% of the following premiums will be used in calculating the PayBack:
• Income Continuation Benefit
• Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit
• Overhead Expenses Benefit.
In addition, all premiums and contributions to the following benefits will be excluded when calculating the PayBack:
• Paid-up benefit
• Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion
• Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion
• Vitality
• Discovery Retirement Optimiser
• Premiums waived while the policy is in waiver status
• Global Education Protector
• Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund.
During the time that premiums are waived on the Life Plan as a result of the Premium Waiver Benefits on death, disability and severe illness or for any other reason, the PayBack Fund will not increase.
Regardless of the PayBack structure you qualify for and whether or not you take up the Double PayBack Option, any outstanding premiums will be deducted from the PayBack at the time that the PayBack is paid to you.
WHEN DOES MY PAYBACK EXPIRE?
The PayBacks from your Vitality Integrator will end on the first policy anniversary after you reach age 65, but will at least be provided for 10 years.

================================================================================

WHEN DOES MY PAYBACK EXPIRE?
The PayBacks from your Vitality Integrator will end on the first policy anniversary after you reach age 65, but will at least be provided for 10 years. This means that if your PayBack benefit starts after age 55, it will end 10 years later.
If you are in a position where you have less than five years between your last PayBack payment and turning age 65, you will still be eligible for a PayBack payment at that point. The PayBack calculation will remain unchanged, but will only be based on your eligible premiums between the previous PayBack payment and turning age 65. You will only be eligible for this payment if your PayBack benefit began before you turned age 55.

Content: SECTION 10
The accumulation of PayBacks under each PayBack structure is described below:
THE FIVE-YEARLY PAYBACK
As a member of Vitality with the Comprehensive Vitality Integrator, you are eligible for the Five-Yearly PayBack.
The Five-Yearly PayBack accumulates a percentage of your qualifying Life Plan premiums in a fund over a five-year period. This fund vests every five years. The PayBack percentage that is applied annually to each year’s qualifying premiums in a particular five-year period is determined by your Personal PayBack Matrix shown on your Policy Schedule and is affected by your Vitality status three months before your policy anniversary (If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary) and when your PayBack will be paid. Discovery Life may alter your Personal PayBack Matrix to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment.
The PayBack calculation works as follows:
• The percentage as per your Personal PayBack matrix of each policy year’s qualifying premiums is accumulated over a five-year period.
• Any claims on the Life Plan (excluding the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus, claims for temporary disability on the Income Continuation Benefit and premium waiver benefit claims) occurring between the start of the five- year period and up to three months before the end of the period are deducted from the amount that has been calculated for over the five-year period.

Content: 
• Any claims on the Life Plan (excluding the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus, claims for temporary disability on the Income Continuation Benefit and premium waiver benefit claims) occurring between the start of the five- year period and up to three months before the end of the period are deducted from the amount that has been calculated for over the five-year period. This means that at the end of the first five year cycle, only the claims in the first 57 months since the PayBack benefit started will be considered. Thereafter, at the end of the second and subsequent five year cycles, the claims occurring in the preceding 60 months will be considered, but with a three month lag.
• If the end value is positive, this Fund will vest at the end of the five-year period.
• Any elective reductions to your Life Plan premiums at any point in a particular five-year period may also reduce your accumulated PayBack fund.
• If your policy is cancelled before the fund vests, any accumulated PayBack Fund will be forfeited.

EXAMPLE
Your policy is Vitality Integrated. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the Five-Yearly PayBack:
In year one your calculated PayBack percentage is 5% based on your Vitality Status. This PayBack percentage is applied to the R12 000 worth of qualifying premiums you paid over the year resulting in R600 (5% x R12 000) being accumulated in your PayBack Fund at the end of year one.
In year three your calculated PayBack percentage is 10% based on your Vitality Status over the last year. This PayBack percentage is applied to the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums you paid over the year and a further R1 452 (10% x R14 520) is added to your accumulated PayBack Fund. This brings the total accumulated PayBack fund at this point to R3 042.
At the end of year five, your calculated PayBack percentage is 15%. R2 635 (15% x R17 569) is added to your accumulated PayBack fund bringing the total accumulated PayBack fund to R8 073. The PayBack fund vests and an amount of R8 073 will be paid to you at the end of year five. Your accumulated PayBack fund resets to zero after you receive your payment.

The Five-Yearly PayBack Fund balance starts again at zero at the beginning of each five-year period, irrespective of claims on your Life Plan over the previous five-year period. You can choose to have your PayBack Fund paid to you immediately or you may defer the payment and double your PayBack percentages by taking up the Double PayBack Option, described below.
You must keep the Vitality Integrator for the entire five-year period to qualify for the Five-Yearly PayBack at the end of that five-year period.

You must keep the Vitality Integrator for the entire five-year period to qualify for the Five-Yearly PayBack at the end of that five-year period. Should you or any life insured on the policy cease to be a member of Vitality for any reason during the five-year period, your Five-Yearly PayBack will also cease and you will not be eligible for a PayBack at the end of the five-year period. This means that any existing PayBack Fund will also fall away. If you change your Life Plan from a Classic or Purple Life Plan to an Essential Life Plan, your PayBack will cease and no payment will be made at the end of the five-year period. If you change your Life Plan from an Essential Life Plan to a Classic Life or Purple Plan that qualifies for PayBack, your first PayBack payment will be made at the first policy anniversary that falls at least five years from the date of changing to the Classic or Purple Life Plan. If you reduce your monthly Life Plan premiums at any point during the five-year period, your total accumulated PayBack Fund to date may be reduced. Please see your servicing schedule for any implications that servicing reductions may have on your PayBack payable at the end of the five-year period.
ANNUAL GUARANTEED PAYBACKS
If you have the Comprehensive Vitality Integrator and you have the Financial Integrator benefit you will be eligible for the Annual Guaranteed PayBack benefit for the first 10 years on your policy. At the end of this initial 10 year period your PayBack accumulation will follow the structure described for the Five-Yearly Payback, described in the previous section.

PayBack which will not vary with your Vitality status. Please refer to your Policy Schedule to see the guarantee percentage that you qualify for. You can choose to have your Annual PayBack paid to you immediately or you may defer the payment and double your PayBack percentages by five years by taking up the Double PayBack Option, described in the next section.
If a higher PayBack percentage is calculated for a particular year based on your Vitality status (as discussed in the Five-Yearly PayBack section above), the difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed PayBack is accumulated in the Surplus PayBack Fund. The Surplus PayBack Fund is paid at the end of year 5 and year 10, and is reduced to zero when the fund is paid out. You can choose to have your Surplus PayBack Fund paid to you immediately or you may defer the payment and double your PayBack percentages by taking up the Double PayBack Option, described in the next section.
Any claims from your Life Plan will only reduce the Surplus PayBack Fund. After the first 10 years any claims from your Life Plan will reduce the full PayBack amount at five-yearly intervals thereafter.
A change to your policy in the Annual Guaranteed PayBack 10 year period will not result in a new 10 year term commencing for any part of your policy. The original Annual Guarantee PayBack period will still terminate 10 years after adding the Financial Integrator to your plicy for the first time.

EXAMPLE
Your policy is Vitality Integrated. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the Annual Guaranteed PayBack:
In year one the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 5%. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 5% of the R12 000 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year one. This results in an Annual Payback of R1 200 (10% x R12 000) and is paid to you at the end of year one. The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 5% based on your Vitality Status. Since the calculated PayBack percentage is equal to the Guaranteed PayBack percentage no contribution is made to the Surplus PayBack Fund.
In year three the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 5%. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 5% of the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year three and is paid at the end of year three (R1 452). The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 10% based on your Vitality Status. The difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed Payback is R726 ([10%-5%] x R14 520) and the Accumulated Surplus Fund grows to R1 056.
At the end of year five, the Annual Guaranteed PayBack is R878 (5% x R17 569) and the accumulation in the Surplus PayBack Fund is

DOUBLE PAYBACK OPTION
In addition to the PayBack structure you qualify for, as described above, you may choose to add the Double PayBack Option to your Life Plan. The Double PayBack Option results in a doubling of the PayBack percentage you qualify for, as well as a doubling of the guarantee percentage if you qualify for Annual Guaranteed PayBack, but will delay the payment of your PayBack by 5 years. For the Five-yearly PayBack this will result in your first PayBack payment being paid on your 10th policy anniversary with subsequent payments made every five years thereafter. For the Annual Guaranteed PayBack, annual guaranteed payments will be paid for ten years on each policy anniversary starting from your sixth policy anniversary. Your Surplus PayBack fund will be paid on your 10th and 15th policy anniversary respectively.
If you qualify for the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, your annual guaranteed PayBack payments will still be paid for 10 years. Thereafter your PayBack accumulation and payment will follow the structure described for the Five-Yearly PayBack with the Double PayBack Option, as described above.
The PayBack percentage you qualify for will depend your Vitality statusthree months before your policy anniversary. If your Vitality Status at the time of your policy anniversary is better than your Vitality Status three months before your anniversary, we will use your Vitality Status at your policy anniversary.

Your policy is Vitality Integrated and you have the Financial Integrator benefit, which means that your PayBack accumulation will follow the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure. You have selected the Double PayBack Option. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the payments under the Double PayBack Option:
In year one the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 5%. Since you have selected the Double PayBack Option this your guarantee percentage is doubled to 10%. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 10% of the R12 000 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year one. This results in an Annual Payback of R1 200 (10% x R12 000). This PayBack will be paid at the end of your sixth policy year. The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 5% based on your Vitality Status. Your PayBack percentage is doubled to 10% because you have selected the Double PayBack Option. Since the calculated PayBack percentage is equal to the Guaranteed PayBack percentage no contribution is made to the Surplus PayBack Fund.
In year three the Annual Guaranteed PayBack percentage is 10%. The Annual Guaranteed PayBack is 10% of the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums that you paid over year three and is paid at the end of year eight (R1 452). The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 20% based on your Vitality Status and because you have selected the Double PayBack Option.

Content:  The calculated PayBack percentage for this year is 20% based on your Vitality Status and because you have selected the Double PayBack Option. The difference between the calculated PayBack and the Annual Guaranteed Payback is R1 452 ([20% - 10%] x R14 520) and your accumulated Surplus Fund grows to R2 112.
At the end of year five, the calculated Annual Guaranteed PayBack over that year is R1 757 (20% x R17 569) which will be paid at the end of year 10 and the accumulated Surplus PayBack Fund is R8 820. The accumulated Surplus PayBack Fund includes the difference between the Annual Guaranteed Payback and calculated PayBack for year five ([30%-10%] x R17 569 = R3 514). Assuming there were no claims on your Life Plan over the accumulation period, the accumulated Surplus PayBack Fund will be paid out at the end of year 10.

WHAT HAPPENS TO MY PAYBACK IF I PASS AWAY DURING THE DEFERRED PERIOD?
Should you pass away during the deferred period your nominated beneficiaries will receive the PayBack payment that would have been accumulated under the Five-Yearly PayBack structure or the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, without the Double PayBack Option.

EXAMPLE
Continuing with the example above, you pass away in the seventh year of your Life Plan. Your PayBack payment will be recalculated using the Guaranteed PayBack percentage and the Personal PayBack matrix that applies under the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure and your beneficiaries will receive the following payments:
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your second policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your seventh policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 320)
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your third policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your eighth policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 452)
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your fourth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your ninth policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 597)
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your fifth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your tenth policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 757)
• The Surplus PayBack fund which vested on your fifth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your 10th policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R4 410), and
• The Annual PayBack payment which vested on your sixth policy anniversary and was due to be paid on your 11th policy anniversary, recalculated at the lower PayBack percentage (R1 933)
The total Payback death payment will be R12 469.

Content:  You have the option of receiving your PayBack immediately rather than waiting until the end of the deferred period. If you choose to receive your PayBack immediately you will qualify for the PayBack payments described under the Five-yearly PayBack structure or the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, if you have the Financial Integrator benefit. Once you have decided to remove the Double PayBack Option from your Life Plan, all future PayBack payments will be paid as they vest under the Five-Yearly or Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, unless you opt into the Double PayBack Option again.
Opting in and out of the Double PayBack Option is subject to the following restrictions:
• You may only opt out of the Double PayBack Option twice. Opting out of the Double PayBack option can only happen during the first 10 years after qualifying for PayBacks.
• You may opt in to the Double PayBack option at any time during your policy lifetime.
Any PayBack payments or vested Surplus PayBack fund which had been deferred will be paid to you at your next policy anniversary after you have opted out of the Double PayBack Option, in addition to any annual PayBack payment, or vested Surplus PayBack Fund due at that time. These payments will not be doubled but will be calculated using the Personal PayBack matrices you qualified for under the Five-Yearly PayBack structure or the Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, without the Double PayBack Option. Any deferred PayBack payment which was due to be paid on your next policy anniversary after the servicing change will also be calculated using the PayBack percentage applicable without the effect of the Double PayBack Option.

calculated on the Personal PayBack matrix applicable without the effect of the Double PayBack Option and any claims on the Life Plan (excluding the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus, claims for temporary disability on the Income Continuation Benefit and premium waiver benefit claims) in the five year accumulation period will reduce your PayBack payment. This may result in a lower, or possibly no PayBack payment remaining after claims have been deducted.
HOW DOES THE DOUBLE PAYBACK OPTION AFFECT THE PAYBACK EXPIRY?
The PayBack from your Vitality Integrator will still end when you reach age 65, or 10 years after your PayBack benefit started, if this is later. If you have taken up the Double PayBack Option your final PayBack payment will be paid five years after you reach PayBack expiry age.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The Double PayBack Option is subject to the following:
• Any claims on your Life Plan during the 5-year deferred period will not reduce the PayBack payment under the Double PayBack Option.
• Your Life Plan must remain in-force for the full deferred period. If you lapse your Life Plan during the deferred period you will forfeit any PayBack payments which you have deferred.
• If you perform servicing on your Life Plan during the deferred period in such a way that your premium reduces, your PayBack payment under the Double PayBack Option may be reduced proportionately.

10.3.2 ANNUAL PREMIUM REVIEW
On the Life Plan policy anniversary, the premiums for all benefits will increase as described in Section 4.1.
In addition, the premiums for all benefits on your Life Plan (except Vitality, Vitality Active, the Discovery Retirement Optimiser and Buy-up Income Continuation Fund) may increase or decrease annually on the policy anniversary by an additional percentage, depending on the life assured’s Vitality Active status as at three months prior to policy anniversary. These additional annual increases/decreases are shown in the Active Integrator Matrix below:

Content: SECTION 10
For example, assume that your premium is R500 and you have selected an automatic annual premium increase of 10% and that you have a Bronze Vitality Active status, giving an additional 1% increase. Your premium after the increases have been applied will be as follows: R500 x (1 + 10%) x (1 + 1%) = R555.50.
Please note that Discovery Life may adjust your Active Integrator Matrix on an annual basis to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment.
Note that premium reductions attributable to your Vitality Active status (over the lifetime of the policy) may never reduce the premium to a level below what the premium would have been on an equivalent Non-Integrated policy less the applicable initial premium reduction detailed above. In other words, no discounts in addition to the initial Active Integrator discount will be possible.
Given that the principal and spouse may have different Vitality Active statuses, if there is a spouse who is insured on the policy,
the percentage increase applied to all benefits is the average of the principal and spouse percentages.
EXAMPLE
If the principal's Vitality Active status is Bronze (giving an additional 1% premium increase) and the spouse's Vitality Active status is Silver (giving an additional 0.5% premium increase), the additional percentage increase applied to the policy is (1.

Content: 5% premium increase), the additional percentage increase applied to the policy is (1.00% + 0.50%) ÷ 2 = 0.75%.
Should you cease to be a member of Vitality Active, the additional annual premium increase percentage due to the Active Integrator will be at a fixed rate of 1.75% per year instead of using the Active Integrator Matrix above, unless you upgrade, then new Integrator increases will apply.
Should your Active Integrator plan lapse and should you purchase another life plan at some future date, the initial premium reduction percentage on the new plan may be reduced by any increases that you had on your original policy as a result of the Active Integrator Matrix.
If you or your spouse (if applicable) have claimed on either Severe Illness Benefit (Severity A or B) or the Capital Disability Benefit (Category A, B or D), the Active Integrator annual premium adjustment is limited to 0% after claim. Negative adjustments will still apply for those clients who have a Vitality Active status of Gold or Diamond, subject to the maximum Active Integrator discount allowed.
The Active Integrator annual premium adjustment is capped at 0% only from the policy anniversary after the qualifying claim has been finalised and completely processed by Discovery Life. If a claim has been reported but not finalised at policy anniversary, the cap will not be applied.

10.3.4 PAYBACK STRUCTURES AVAILABLE ON THE ACTIVE INTEGRATOR (ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC AND PURPLE LIFE PLANS)
WHAT PAYBACK STRUCTURE IS AVAILABLE TO ME?
As a member of Vitality Active with the Active Integrator, you will benefit by receiving Five-Yearly PayBacks from the Active Integrator. The PayBack is payable and only vests every five years.
In addition to the Five-Yearly PayBack you can select the Double PayBack Option which allows you to double your PayBack percentage. If you select this option, each PayBack payment that was due on the PayBack structure you selected above will only vest five years later.
The PayBack will only be paid to the owner of the policy.
The PayBack will have no impact on your Life Fund.
HOW IS MY PAYBACK CALCULATED?
The value of your PayBack is determined by a percentage of all qualifying Classic or Purple Life Plan premiums used in the calculation of your PayBack at each policy anniversary.
Only 70% of the following premiums will be used in calculating the PayBack:
• Income Continuation Benefit
• Top-Up Income Continuation Benefit
• Overhead Expenses Benefit.
In addition, all premiums and contributions to the following benefits will be excluded when calculating the PayBack:
• Paid-up benefit
• Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion
• Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion
• Vitality Active
• Discovery Retirement Optimiser
• Premiums waived while the policy is in waiver status
• Global Education Protector
• Buy-Up Income Continuation Fund.
During the time that premiums are waived on the Life Plan as a result of the Premium Waiver Benefits on death, disability and severe illness or for any other reason, the PayBack Fund will not increase.

================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-445
Content: 
During the time that premiums are waived on the Life Plan as a result of the Premium Waiver Benefits on death, disability and severe illness or for any other reason, the PayBack Fund will not increase.
Regardless of whether you take up the Double PayBack Option or not, any outstanding premiums will be deducted from the PayBack at the time that the PayBack is paid to you.
WHEN DOES MY PAYBACK EXPIRE?
The PayBacks from your Active Integrator will end on the first policy anniversary after you reach age 65, but will at least be provided for 10 years. This means that if your PayBack benefit starts after age 55, it will end 10 years later.
If you are in a position where you have less than five years between your last PayBack payment and turning age 65, you will still be eligible for a PayBack payment at that point. The PayBack calculation will remain unchanged, but will only be based on your eligible premiums between the previous PayBack payment and turning age 65. You will only be eligible for this payment if your PayBack benefit began before you turned age 55.
The accumulation of PayBacks under each PayBack structure is described below:
THE FIVE-YEARLY PAYBACK
As a member of Vitality Active with the Comprehensive Active Integrator, you are eligible for the Five-Yearly PayBack.

Content: SECTION 10
The Five-Yearly PayBack accumulates a percentage of your qualifying Life Plan premiums in a fund over a five-year period. This fund vests every five years. The PayBack percentage that is applied annually to each year’s qualifying premiums in a particular five-year period is determined by your Personal PayBack Matrix shown on your Policy Schedule and is affected by your Vitality Active status at your policy anniversary and when your PayBack will be paid. Discovery Life may alter your Personal PayBack Matrix to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment.
The PayBack calculation works as follows:
• The percentage as per your Personal PayBack Matrix of each policy year’s qualifying premiums is accumulated over a five-year period.
• Any claims on the Life Plan (excluding the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus, claims for temporary disability on the Income Continuation Benefit and premium waiver benefit claims) occurring between the start of the five- year period and up to three months before the end of the period are deducted from the amount that has been calculated for over the five-year period. This means that at the end of first five year cycle, only the claims in the first 57 months since the PayBack benefit started will be considered. Thereafter, at the end of the second and subsequent five year cycles, the claims occurring in the preceding 60 months will be considered, but with a three month lag.

Content:  Thereafter, at the end of the second and subsequent five year cycles, the claims occurring in the preceding 60 months will be considered, but with a three month lag.
• If the end value is positive, this Fund will vest at the end of the five-year period.
• Any elective reductions to your Life Plan premiums at any point in a particular five-year period may also reduce your accumulated PayBack fund.
• If your policy is cancelled before the fund vests, any accumulated PayBack Fund will be forfeited.
EXAMPLE
Your policy is Active Integrated. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the Five-Yearly PayBack:
In year one your calculated PayBack percentage is 0% based on your Vitality Active Status. There will not be any contribution to the PayBack Fund at the end of year one.
In year three your calculated PayBack percentage is 5% based on your Vitality Active Status over the last year. This PayBack percentage is applied to the R14 520 worth of qualifying premiums you paid over the year and a further R726 (5% x R14 520) is added to your accumulated PayBack Fund. This brings the total accumulated PayBack fund at this point to R1 056.
At the end of year five, your calculated PayBack percentage is 10%. R1 757 (10% x R17 569) is added to your accumulated PayBack fund bringing the total accumulated PayBack fund to R4 410.

PayBack Option, described below.
You must keep the Active Integrator for the entire five-year period to qualify for the Five-Yearly PayBack at the end of that five-year period. Should you or any life insured on the policy cease to be a member of Vitality Active for any reason during the five-year period, your Five-Yearly PayBack will also cease and you will not be eligible for a PayBack at the end of the five-year period. This means that any existing PayBack Fund will also fall away. If you change your Life Plan from a Classic or Purple Life Plan to an Essential Life Plan, your PayBack will cease and no payment will be made at the end of the five-year period. If you change your Life Plan from an Essential Life Plan to a Classic Life or Purple Plan that qualifies for PayBack, your first PayBack payment will be made at the first policy anniversary that falls at least five years from the date of changing to the Classic or Purple Life Plan. If you reduce your monthly Life Plan premiums at any point during the five-year period, your total accumulated PayBack Fund to date may be reduced. Please see your servicing schedule for any implications that servicing reductions may have on your PayBack payable at the end of the five-year period.

In addition to the Five-Yearly PayBack structure, as described above, you may choose to add the Double PayBack Option to your Life Plan. The Double PayBack Option results in a doubling of the PayBack percentage you qualify for, but will delay the payment of your PayBack by 5 years. For the Five-yearly PayBack this will result in your first PayBack payment being paid on your 10th policy anniversary with subsequent payments made every five years thereafter.
The PayBack percentage you qualify for will depend your Vitality Active status at your policy anniversary. Please refer to your Policy Schedule for the PayBack matrix.
EXAMPLE
Your policy is Active Integrated and you have selected the Double PayBack Option. Your qualifying premium starts at R1 000 per month for year one and increases by 10% every year. The following summarises the payments under the Double PayBack Option:
In year one your calculated PayBack percentage is 0% based on your Vitality Active Status. There will not be any contribution to the PayBack Fund at the end of year one.
In year three your calculated PayBack percentage is 5% based on your Vitality Active Status over the last year. Your PayBack percentage is doubled to 10% because you have selected the Double PayBack Option. This PayBack percentage is applied to the R14 520 worth of qualifying premium you paid over the year and a further R1 452 (10% x R14 520) is added to your accumulated PayBack Fund.

Content: 
Up to one week before you reach your policy anniversary you can change when you would like to receive your PayBack payments. You have the option of receiving your PayBack immediately rather than waiting until the end of the deferred period. If you choose to receive your PayBack immediately you will qualify for the PayBack payments described under the Five-yearly PayBack. Once you have decided to remove the Double PayBack Option from your Life Plan, all future PayBack payments will be paid as they vest under the Five-Yearly or Annual Guaranteed PayBack structure, unless you opt into the Double PayBack Option again.
Opting in and out of the Double PayBack Option is subject to the following restrictions:
• You may only opt out of the Double PayBack Option twice. Opting out of the Double PayBack option can only happen during the first 10 years after qualifying for PayBacks.
• You may opt in to the Double PayBack option at any time during your policy lifetime.
Any PayBack payment which had been deferred will be paid to you at your next policy anniversary after you have opted out of the Double PayBack Option. These payments will not be doubled but will be calculated using the Personal PayBack matrices you qualified for under the Five-Yearly PayBack structure. Any deferred PayBack payment which was due to be paid on your next policy anniversary after the servicing change will also be calculated using the PayBack percentage applicable without the effect of the Double PayBack Option.

Content:  Any deferred PayBack payment which was due to be paid on your next policy anniversary after the servicing change will also be calculated using the PayBack percentage applicable without the effect of the Double PayBack Option.
Please note that if you choose to service to the Five-Yearly PayBack structure, your PayBack payment will be re-calculated on the Personal PayBack matrix applicable without the effect of the Double PayBack Option and any claims on the Life Plan (excluding the AccessCover, AccessCover Plus, claims for temporary disability on the Income Continuation Benefit and premium waiver benefit claims) in the five year accumulation period will reduce your PayBack payment. This may result in a lower, or possibly no PayBack payment remaining after claims have been deducted.
HOW DOES THE DOUBLE PAYBACK OPTION AFFECT THE PAYBACK EXPIRY?
The PayBack from your Active Integrator will still end when you reach age 65, or 10 years after your PayBack benefit started, if this is later. If you have taken up the Double PayBack Option your final PayBack payment will be paid five years after you reach PayBack expiry age.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The Double PayBack Option is subject to the following:
• Any claims on your Life Plan during the 5-year deferred period will not reduce the PayBack payment under the Double PayBack Option.
• Your Life Plan must remain in-force for the full deferred period.

Content: SECTION 10
• If you perform servicing on your Life Plan during the deferred period in such a way that your premium reduces, your PayBack payment under the Double PayBack Option may be reduced proportionately.
10.3.5 POLICY SERVICING RESTRICTIONS
The Active Integrator is designed for clients who are not members of Vitality. If you and/or your spouse (if applicable) become members of Vitality after taking out an Active Integrator policy, future servicing of your policy will be limited.
10.4 BANK INTEGRATOR
The Bank Integrator may be selected as an Integrator on your Life Plan as long as the principal life assured has a Discovery Bank account or a previous Discovery Card. The Bank Integrator can be selected on its own or in addition to the Vitality, Health or Active Integrator.
10.4.1 INITIAL PREMIUM REDUCTION
On the Bank Integrator, all premiums (except Vitality, Vitality Active, Discovery Retirement Optimiser, Cover Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion; Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion and Buy-up Income Continuation Fund) are reduced by a percentage that depends on the colour of your associated Discovery Bank account or previous Discovery Card, the funding plan chosen on your Life Plan, and whether your Life Plan qualifies for Comprehensive or Core Integration.
In the case of you having more than one Discovery Bank account or previous Discovery Card, the premium reduction will be based on the account or previous Discovery Card colour associated with the highest discount across all your Linked Discovery Bank accounts.
Page Number: 127
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-459
Content: 
In the case of you having more than one Discovery Bank account or previous Discovery Card, the premium reduction will be based on the account or previous Discovery Card colour associated with the highest discount across all your Linked Discovery Bank accounts.
Your Linked Discovery Bank accounts are the Discovery Bank accounts that your Bank Integrator will link to and are defined as:
All Discovery Bank Transactional Accounts and/or Discovery Bank Card Accounts and/or previous Discovery Cards where you are either the primary or secondary cardholder on that account.
The initial Bank Integrator premium reductions will be indicated in your Policy Schedule.
The Bank Integrator premium reduction is applied multiplicatively to the Health Integrator, Vitality Integrator or Active Integrator premium reduction (where applicable).
EXAMPLE
Your Life Plan premium before integration is R1 000 a month. You integrate your policy with both the Health and Bank Integrator. You qualify for a discount of 15% on the Health Integrator and 10% on the Bank Integrator. Your monthly premium is then R765 which is R1 000 x (100% - 15%) x (100% - 10%).
Please note that if you change the colour of Discovery Bank account or previous Discovery Card, Life Plan, Funding Plan or Integrator type at any time during the term of your policy, your initial premium reduction will update to reflect the changes you have made.
10.4.2 ANNUAL PREMIUM REVIEW
On the policy anniversary of your Life Plan, the premiums for all benefits will increase as described in Section 4.
Page Number: 127
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-460
Content: 
10.4.2 ANNUAL PREMIUM REVIEW
On the policy anniversary of your Life Plan, the premiums for all benefits will increase as described in Section 4.1.
In addition, the premiums for all benefits on your Life Plan (except Vitality, Vitality Active, the Discovery Retirement Optimiser, Cover Integrator Buy-Up Cash Conversion, Financial Integrator Buy-up Cash Conversion, and Buy-up Income Continuation Fund) may increase or decrease on the policy anniversary by an additional percentage. The Personal Bank Matrix shown on your Policy Schedule determines the additional percentage increase or decrease.
This additional percentage will depend on your Vitality Money status, the colour of your Discovery Bank account or previous Discovery Card and your qualifying card spend, which will be the average monthly level of qualifying spend made on all your Linked Discovery Bank accounts, over the 12 months preceding policy anniversary. Discovery Life will use your Vitality Money status three months before your policy anniversary to determine your adjustment from the Personal Bank Matrix. Please note that in the case of you having multiple Discovery Bank accounts or previous Discovery Cards, the additional percentage will be based on the best colour across all your Linked Discovery Bank accounts or previous Discovery Cards.

Content: SECTION 10
Premium reductions attributable to your Personal Bank Matrix (over the lifetime of the Life Plan) may never reduce the premium to a level below what the premium would have been on an equivalent Non-Integrated Life Plan less the applicable initial premium reduction detailed above. In other words, no discounts in addition to the initial Bank Integrator discount will be possible.
If you or your spouse have claimed on either the Severe Illness Benefit (Severity A or B) or the Capital Disability Benefit (Category A, B or D), the Bank Integrator annual premium adjustment is limited to 0% after claim. Negative adjustments will still apply for those clients who are highly engaged, subject to the maximum Integration premium reduction specified above.
The Bank Integrator annual premium adjustment is capped at 0% only from the policy anniversary after the qualifying claim has been finalised and completely processed by Discovery Life. If a claim has been reported but not finalised at policy anniversary, the cap will not be applied. This cap will only apply while you are still a life assured on the policy and will fall away if the benefits on this policy are serviced in such a way that there is an increase in the policy premiums.
The Personal Bank Matrix is not guaranteed and will be reviewed annually by Discovery Life to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment.

================================================================================

Content: 
The Personal Bank Matrix is not guaranteed and will be reviewed annually by Discovery Life to take account of emerging experience over time, with due consideration for the general economic and regulatory environment. Furthermore, should changes occur in the future such that the Personal Bank Matrix is no longer relevant (e.g. Discovery Bank cancels
Vitality Money), then Discovery Life reserves the right to alter the wealth management criteria used to determine the annual premium adjustments.
The transactions used to determine your card spend are defined as purchases on all the cards linked to your Linked Discovery Bank accounts, where a merchant fee is charged. We may review the amounts taken into consideration in calculating your card spend from time to time. Transactions that will not be taken into account include (but are not limited to):
• Cash withdrawals
• Money transfers, for example money transferred to a current account of a retailer or service provider, or inter- account transfers
• Debit orders.
The additional percentage attributable to the Personal Bank Matrix is applied multiplicatively to the automatic annual premium increase that you selected on your Life Plan. The Personal Bank Matrix will be used multiplicatively with the Vitality Matrix, Active Integrator Matrix or the Personal Health Matrix to determine annual premium increases or decreases.
EXAMPLE
Assume that your premium is R500 and you have selected an automatic annual premium increase of 10%, the applicable adjustment on your Personal Bank Matrix is an increase of 1% and that the applicable adjustment on your Personal Health Matrix
is an increase of 1.

Content: 
EXAMPLE
Assume that your premium is R500 and you have selected an automatic annual premium increase of 10%, the applicable adjustment on your Personal Bank Matrix is an increase of 1% and that the applicable adjustment on your Personal Health Matrix
is an increase of 1.5%. Then your new premium will be: R500 x (1 + 10%) x (1 + 1%) x (1 + 1.5%) = R563.83.
Should you cease to be a member of Vitality Money, or cancel all of your Discovery Bank accounts or previous Discovery Cards, the additional annual premium increase percentage due to the Bank Integrator will be at a default rate of 2.75% per year instead of using the Personal Bank Matrix.
Should your Bank Integrator Life Plan lapse and should you purchase another Life Plan at some future date, the initial premium reduction percentage on the new plan will be reduced by any increases that you had on your original policy as a result of the Personal Bank Matrix.
Please note that if for any reason you are not enrolled on the Vitality Money programme when the Bank Integrator is taken out, you will be treated as a Blue Vitality Money Status. Additionally, if your Vitality Money Status is classified as “unengaged” by Discovery Bank, you will be treated in line with a Blue Vitality Money Status for the annual premium review.
10.4.3 THE BANK INTEGRATOR’S MAXIMUM PROTECTED PREMIUM
In addition to normal premium guarantees, Discovery Life guarantees that your premium (plus any premium increases above any automatic annual increases) on the Bank Integrator will not exceed the Maximum Protected Premium.

Content:  Please see section 9.5 for more detail on this benefit.
10.5 THE MANAGED CARE INTEGRATOR
The Managed Care Integrator may be offered only for a life assured on your life plan in the event that the underwriters have imposed a premium loading for that life assured in respect of any or all of the Severe Illness, Capital Disability or Life Cover Benefits because of Diabetes, HIV or Obesity. A loading imposed for any other condition will not qualify for this benefit.
In addition, the following conditions also need to be met for consideration to be given if the benefit may be offered:
• The Diabetes, HIV or Obesity has not progressed to the extent that the conditions have given rise to other co-morbid conditions.
• The Life Assured is registered as a member of Discovery Health Medical Scheme or as a member of a participating scheme administered by Discovery Health.
• The Life Assured is a member of Vitality.
• The Life Assured is enrolled on the specified management programme that is recommended for their condition through either Discovery Health or Vitality. You may be offered the Managed Care Integrator if you meet all criteria except being on the recommended managed care programme for your condition. In this instance, you will have three months from the commencement of the policy to enrol in the programme otherwise the Managed Care Integrator will be removed from your policy.
• The Life Assured is a non-smoker.
The Managed Care Integrator may include the following features, please check your Policy Schedule to see which features are included for the life assured’s specified condition:
• A discount to the life assured’s Health Loadings which are applied to their Life Cover, Capital Disability or Severe Illness premium
• An automatic re-assessment of the life assured’s Health Loadings which are applied to their Life Cover, Capital Disability or Severe Illness premium at every anniversary with automatic reduction of the Health Loa

The health loading on the Life Cover may be reduced to 0% if the criteria are met.
• An opportunity to apply for Capital Disability and Severe Illness cover in the event that the life assured was previously declined this cover but has since showed the required improvement in management of the specific condition.
• A PayBack of 50% of the amount the premium reduces by in the year that the life assured’s Health Loading reduces as a result of the automatic re-assessment of the life assured’s health loading at anniversary.

Content: SECTION 10
10.5.1 MANAGED CARE INTEGRATOR DISCOUNT
Through the Managed Care Integrator you may qualify for a discount of 10% to be applied to the life assured’s Health Loadings on their Life Cover, Capital Disability and Severe Illness Benefit loadings.
In order to maintain the Managed Care Integrator discount at each anniversary the life assured must demonstrate that they are actively managing their medical condition through engagement with the recommended management programme on which they are registered. Engagement is measured through completing activities required by the specific management programme that result in earning Vitality points. The life assured will need to earn a specified minimum number of Vitality points that are specific to their condition in order to maintain the 10% discount on the policy. Where the client loses their Managed Care Integrator Discount, there will be a resultant increase in premium.
We will check for the number of points earned over the previous year, three months prior to anniversary. If the life assured fails to meet the minimum Vitality point requirement the discount will be removed and they will not be able to qualify for it again. If the management programme has been in force for less than 12 months the required Vitality points will be proportionately adjusted.
The Policy Schedule will clearly indicate what points the life assured need to earn and how they can be earned.

Content: 
The Policy Schedule will clearly indicate what points the life assured need to earn and how they can be earned.
FOR EXAMPLE:
A life assured is quoted a Life Cover premium of R1 000 and a Capital Disability premium of R2 300. The client is underwritten and it emerges that he is Diabetic. The underwriters offer the client cover with a Life Cover Health Loading of 100% and a Capital Disability Health Loading of 150%. This translates to a Life Cover premium of R2 000 (R1 000 x [1+100%]) and a Capital Disability premium of R5 750 (R2 300 x [1+150%]).
This life assured’s medical condition qualifies him for the Managed Care Integrator. If he is offered the Managed Care Integrator he will receive a 10% discount to his Life Cover Health Loading and Capital Disability Health loading leading to 90% and 135% health loadings respectively. This means the Life Cover premium charged is R1 900 (R1 000 x [1+90%]) and the Capital Disability Premium charged is R5 405 (R2 300 x [1+135%]).
10.5.2 ASSESSMENT OF YOUR HEALTH LOADING THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE INTEGRATOR
At every anniversary we will assess the life assured’s medical condition and if their health has improved we may lower their Life Cover, Capital Disability and Severe Illness Health Loadings. For each condition there are specific metrics that we need to monitor to be able to conclude if the condition is managed.
Page Number: 130
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-470
Content:  For each condition there are specific metrics that we need to monitor to be able to conclude if the condition is managed. For each metric a score is applied, the sum of the scores across all metrics will make up the Managed Care Integrator Score. The Managed Care Integrator score translates to the health loading that the life assured should qualify for that would be applicable to the life assured’s Life Cover, Capital Disability or Severe Illness premium. The Policy Schedule will clearly indicate which metrics we will measure and how they are used to determine the Managed Care Integrator score. These metrics may be adjusted over time.
We will obtain the Managed Care Integrator Score if the life assured completes the required tests as indicated by their specified management programme and they are a member of Discovery Health Medical Scheme or a member of a qualifying scheme administered by Discovery Health.
FOR EXAMPLE:
A diabetic life assured currently has a loading of 125% on their Life Cover premium. They perform all the required tests and we are able to determine a Diabetic Managed Care Integrator Score that indicates that the client qualifies for a loading of 75%. We will reduce the health loading at anniversary.
The next year the life assured performs all the required tests but the Diabetic Managed Care Integrator Score indicates that the client qualifies for a loading of 100%.

================================================================================

Content: 
The next year the life assured performs all the required tests but the Diabetic Managed Care Integrator Score indicates that the client qualifies for a loading of 100%. We will make no change to the loading.
The next year the life assured fails to perform all their required tests and so no change will be made to the loading.

Content: SECTION 10
We will obtain these metrics three months prior to anniversary. The required metrics must be from tests that were performed in the year prior to this. The anniversary letter will outline a Managed Care Integrator score that is calculated. Where the suggested health loadings are lower than the loadings in force, we will reduce them at anniversary. Where the suggested health loadings are higher or equal to the loadings in force, the health loadings will remain unchanged. If any of the required metrics are missing, we will not be able to calculate a Managed Care Integrator score and the life assured’s health loadings will remain unchanged that year.
Before reducing your health loading through the process outlined above we may require a health declaration to determine if, other than the medical condition we are monitoring, the life assured health has changed. You may request to review the health loading at any stage outside of the process described above.
10.5.3 OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR CAPITAL DISABILITY AND SEVERE ILLNESS
This opportunity is only available for Diabetic clients who have the Managed Care Integrator. Initially, the life assured may not qualify for Capital Disability or Severe Illness due to the fact that their diabetes is not as well managed as it should be. If the life assured is able to improve their Diabetic Score through improved management of their condition, they can be given the opportunity to purchase the accelerated Capital Disability Benefit or the accelerated Severe Illness Benefit.

================================================================================

Content:  If the life assured is able to improve their Diabetic Score through improved management of their condition, they can be given the opportunity to purchase the accelerated Capital Disability Benefit or the accelerated Severe Illness Benefit. Please note that if the life assured qualified for Accidental Disability this would have been offered to them upfront and is not part of the opportunity described here.
Depending on how well managed the condition has become there may be limits on what percentage of the Life Fund may be selected for the life assured’s Capital Disability and Severe Illness benefits. Where the life assured has not yet accessed the opportunity to purchase up to 100% of your Life Fund, there are restrictions on the type of cover that can be purchased:
• Capital Disability must be Core Capital Disability with an expiry age of 65. No converted Severe Illness will apply to this Capital Disability.
• Severe Illness must be Comprehensive Severe Illness with an expiry age of 65.
Once the opportunity to purchase 100% of your Life Fund is available any accelerated Capital Disability or Severe Illness benefit option may be purchased.
If the life assured has opted for Accidental Disability they may elect to purchase the Capital Disability up to the amount that they have accessed but the sum of the Accidental Disability and Capital Disability benefit percentages cannot be more than 100%.
Your anniversary letter will indicate to you when you have the opportunity to purchase Capital Disability or Severe Illness cover.

Content: 
Your anniversary letter will indicate to you when you have the opportunity to purchase Capital Disability or Severe Illness cover. You must then contact your financial adviser and follow the usual process to add a new benefit to your policy, for that life assured. The life assured may be underwritten when adding or increasing either of these benefits and cover is therefore not guaranteed.
10.5.4 MANAGED CARE INTEGRATOR PAYBACK
This benefit applies to Classic or Purple Plans only. This PayBack is based on the Life Cover, Capital Disability and Severe Illness Benefit Loadings for the life assured who has the Managed Care Integrator benefit. This PayBack is independent of any PayBack paid under the Health Integrator, Active Integrator or Vitality Integrator
At anniversary we check the health loading that has applied over the last year against the health loading that will apply going forward. Where the life assured has improved their health loading through the automatic assessment process at anniversary, we will calculate the premium that would have been paid over the last year had it been on the lower health loading and we will accumulate 50% of the difference into the Managed Care Integrator PayBack fund which will pay out at the end of every five year period.

Content: SECTION 10
EXAMPLE:
A client has a monthly life cover premium of R2 000 and a monthly Capital Disability premium of R5 750. Included in these premiums is a health loading of 100% for Life Cover and 150% for Capital Disability. Assume the client has not maintained the 10% discount to the loading.
At anniversary, through the Managed Care Integrator, the loadings are reduced to 50% for Life Cover and 100% for Capital Disability. The premiums payable over the last year would have been R1 500 [R2 000 x (1+50%) ÷ (1+100%)] per month for the Life Cover and R4 600 [R5 750 x (1+100%) ÷ (1+150%)] per month for Capital Disability if the lower loadings applied.
Premiums received over the year were R93 000 (R2 000 x 12 + R5 750 x 12) based on the loading at the start of the year.
Premiums received over the year would have been R73 200 (R1 500 x 12 + R4 600 x 12) based on the reviewed loading at anniversary.
The PayBack accumulated would therefore be R9 900 [(R93 000 - R73 200) x 50%] and will be paid at the end of year 5.
The Managed Care Integrator PayBack will not be reduced by any claims paid on the policy. A life assured may request a review of their health loadings outside of the Managed Care Integrator process. If a life assured requests a review, the underwriter will assess whether or not the condition has improved sufficiently to reduce the applicable health loading. There is no PayBack if the health loading is reduced outside of the Managed Care Integrator process.

Content:  There is no PayBack if the health loading is reduced outside of the Managed Care Integrator process.
10.5.5 WHEN WILL THE MANAGED CARE INTEGRATOR BE REMOVED FROM A POLICY
If any of the following occurs, the Managed Care Integrator will be removed from the life assured:
• If the life assured claims against any Disability or Severe Illness cover that they have with us indicating that medical condition that resulted in the health loading has progressed or that another condition has emerged.
• If the life assured is no longer a member of Discovery Health Medical Scheme or any Health Plan administered by Discovery Health.
• If the life assured is no longer a member of Vitality.
• If the life assured is no longer registered on the required management programme.
• The Health loading on the life assured’s Life Cover premium is reduced to 0%.
• If the life assured becomes a smoker.
As a result of removing the Managed Care Integrator:
• The Managed Care Integrator discount would be removed resulting in a premium increase reverting to the premium that would have been payable had the client not qualified for the Managed Care Integrator discount.
• We will no longer collect the required metrics to monitor the life assured’s management of their condition so the health loading will no longer automatically reduce if the life assured’s management improves.
• The life assured will not qualify for any further Managed Care Integrator Payback.

Content: 
• The life assured will not qualify for any further Managed Care Integrator Payback. Any Managed Care Integrator PayBack Fund already accumulated will be removed except in the scenario where the Managed Care Integrator is removed as a result of reaching standard rates in which case any accumulated PayBack will still be payable after five years.
• The option to purchase Capital Disability and Severe Illness benefits will no longer become available automatically.

11.6 RETIREMENT INVESTMENT INTEGRATOR
As a Discovery Life Plan policyholder you may qualify for the Retirement Investment Integrator which will give you an immediate reduction on yearly administration fees and asset management fees. This reduction will apply in respect of money invested in qualifying Funds.
The size of the fee reduction is dependent on the size of your monthly Discovery Retirement Annuity contribution as shown in the Retirement Investment Integrator table on your Policy Schedule. The table is reviewed yearly in line with the average contribution increases on Discovery Retirement Optimisers.
To qualify for the Retirement Investment Integrator, you must have a Discovery Life Plan with a monthly premium at or above the current minimum qualifying premium, which is available on your Policy Schedule. This minimum Life Plan premium will be updated from time to time. If you make changes to your Discovery Life Plan, your new resultant Life Plan premium will be compared to the minimum qualifying premium for the Retirement Investment Integrator to determine if you qualify for the benefit.
If you make your Retirement Annuity paid up, your Retirement Investment Integrator will end.
QUALIFYING FUNDS
The fee reductions from the Retirement Investment Integrator will apply in respect of Discovery funds (with the exception of the Discovery Money Market Fund), Escalator Funds based on Discovery funds and indices, Medical Investment Funds and Target Retirement Date Funds.

Content: SECTION 11
11.9 CAN I CHANGE MY SELECTED RETIREMENT AGE FROM THE AGE I SELECTED AT THE START OF MY INVESTMENT?
Irrespective of the retirement age you selected at the start of your investment, you may accelerate or defer your actual retirement date, as long as your actual retirement age is age 55 or above. However, you may not alter your selected retirement age in the last five years before your currently selected retirement age.
If your actual retirement age is earlier than your selected, your retirement benefits will be proportionately adjusted on the same basis as discussed in paragraph 10.3. In addition, if you retire before your selected retirement date, your Fee PayBack, Contribution Boost, Life Plan Optimiser and Retirement PayBack Booster may be adjusted. Please see the relevant sections before making any changes.
If you defer your actual retirement age, your investment as well as future contributions will continue until the new retirement date.
11.10 CAN I ADJUST MY MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISCOVERY RETIREMENT OPTIMISER BEFORE THE SELECTED RETIREMENT AGE?
Yes. You may adjust your contributions before the selected retirement date. Additional contributions may be allocated to the available portfolios at that time.
A reduction in contributions will result in a reduction in the member’s share at the time that the contribution is reduced.

Content: 
A reduction in contributions will result in a reduction in the member’s share at the time that the contribution is reduced. This reduction is calculated on the basis described in paragraph 10.3.3 and applies only to a portion of the member’s share. The portion of the member’s share that is reduced is equivalent to the percentage reduction in contribution.
Reducing your contributions will also result in a recalculation of your Life Plan Optimiser benefit, your fee reduction from the Retirement Investment Integrator, your Fee PayBack balance as well as your Retirement PayBack Booster.
If you qualify for the Purple Life Plan Optimiser boost (see section 11.15 below) and you reduce your contributions below the minimum qualifying contribution level for the Purple Life Plan Optimiser Boost, your Life Plan Optimiser will be recalculated. These recalculations are based on the size of your Life Fund and attached ancillary benefits after the reduction in contribution, and the latest Life Plan Optimiser benefit tables.
If you increase your monthly contribution and you meet the qualifying criteria for the Purple Life Plan Optimiser Boost (see section 11.15 below), the Life Plan Optimiser value you have accrued will not be recalculated, but any future Life Plan Optimiser boosts will be recalculated in line with the latest qualifying criteria and Life Plan Optimiser benefit tables.

11.11 WHAT HAPPENS IF I DIE BEFORE MY SELECTED RETIREMENT AGE?
The death benefit amount, as described below, is payable to your nominated beneficiaries. Once Discovery Invest has been notified of your death, we will switch the benefits in your investment to an interest-bearing investment option. Section 37C of the Pension Funds Act then requires the Board of Trustees of the Fund to distribute your investment value equitably between your dependants (whether nominated as beneficiaries or not) and nominated beneficiaries, within 12 months of your death.
If you require a detailed explanation of the terms ‘beneficiary’ and ‘dependant’, please contact Discovery Invest.
You may change your beneficiary nomination at any time by notifying Discovery Invest in writing. Notification must reach Discovery Invest before your death. If this does not happen, the trustees will not consider the notification.
THE DEATH BENEFIT AMOUNT
The death benefit is equivalent to the member share as described in paragraph 10.3 with a minimum value of the sum of contributions paid. The fund value is equivalent to the member’s share. The member’s share is subject to tax according to the Income Tax Act. In addition, if you qualify for the Retirement PayBack Booster, your accrued boost will pay out on your death. Your Fee PayBack and Contribution Boost balances will also pay out a partial entitlement according to the table given in section 11.

11.12 WHAT HAPPENS IF I RETIRE BEFORE THE SELECTED RETIREMENT DATE DUE TO ILL HEALTH?
If you retire due to ill-health as defined in the Pension Funds Act, the member share, as defined in paragraph 10.3, is payable. In this case, the Life Plan Optimiser will be forfeited. Your Fee PayBack and Contribution Boost balances will pay out a partial entitlement according to the table given in section 11.5, depending on the remaining months until your selected retirement date.

11.13 RETIREMENT PAYBACK BOOSTER
The Retirement PayBack Booster allows you to reinvest your PayBacks from your Discovery Life Plan into your Retirement Annuity and have these boosted (with growth) at retirement. This benefit applies to your Annual Guaranteed PayBack.
The boost to your reinvested PayBack and the five-yearly PayBack will be based on the ratio of your Retirement Annuity contribution to your Life Plan premium (excluding your Vitality contribution) at the time of the reinvestment, up to a maximum boost of 100%.
You will have the option to either invest none, half or all of your PayBacks into your Discovery Retirement Optimiser. You will make this selection at the start of your Discovery Retirement Optimiser policy, called your default selection, and you can then change this default selection before every Health or Vitality Integrator PayBack by contacting Discovery Life. If you do not contact Discovery Life to change your reinvestment proportion, your default reinvestment proportion will be applied. Shortly after receiving your PayBack from Discovery Life, the relevant proportion of that PayBack will be withdrawn from the same bank account and invested into your Discovery Retirement Optimiser.
If you lapse your Discovery Life Plan or make your Retirement Annuity paid-up, the Retirement PayBack Booster will fall away, but you will still be entitled to your reinvested Health or Vitality Integrator PayBack in your Retirement Annuity.

If you lapse your Discovery Life Plan or make your Retirement Annuity paid-up, the Retirement PayBack Booster will fall away, but you will still be entitled to your reinvested Health or Vitality Integrator PayBack in your Retirement Annuity. Any reductions in your Retirement Annuity contributions or your Life Plan premium will result in a proportionate reduction of your Retirement PayBack Booster value.
Discovery Invest’s applicable fee structure for lump-sum investments will be applied to the reinvested PayBack. Please see paragraph 10.5b for the relevant fee structure. The reinvested PayBack will not qualify for the Retirement Investment Integrator, Fee PayBack, the Life Plan Optimiser, Ill-Health Income Booster or Contribution Boost.
Any PayBack reinvested within five years of your retirement will not qualify for a boost from the Retirement PayBack Booster. The PayBack will, however, continue to be debited from your account and invested into your Discovery Retirement Optimiser.
TAX TREATMENT
The reinvested Health or Vitality Integrator PayBack will be tax deductible in your hands, up to certain limits, according to the tax tables that apply at the time.
EXAMPLE
A policyholder chooses to reinvest his Health Integrator PayBack into his Retirement Annuity Fund. At the time of the reinvestment, the policyholder is paying a R2 000 monthly Life Plan premium and a R1 000 monthly contribution to his Retirement Annuity Fund.

Content:  At the time of the reinvestment, the policyholder is paying a R2 000 monthly Life Plan premium and a R1 000 monthly contribution to his Retirement Annuity Fund.
The boost to his reinvested PayBack is then R1 000 ÷ R2 000 = 50%. This boost, plus growth, is payable at retirement.
11.14 THE CONTRIBUTION BOOST
The Contribution Boost provides you with additional boosts of up to 15% to your recurring contributions, based on your engagement in Vitality Health, Vitality Drive, and Vitality Money. The Contribution Boost percentages you can receive are determined by adding together the applicable percentages in the tables below:
<table><tr><th rowSpan=2></th><th colSpan=6>VITALITY HEALTH</th></tr><tr><th>NONE</th><th>BLUE</th><th>BRONZE</th><th>SILVER</th><th>GOLD</th><th>DIAMOND</th></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>0.0%</td><td>1.0%</td><td>1.5%</td><td>2.0%</td><td>3.0%</td><td>4.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>1.0%</td><td>2.0%</td><td>2.5%</td><td>3.0%</td><td>4.0%</td><td>5.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Bronze</td><td>1.5%</td><td>2.5%</td><td>3.0%</td><td>3.5%</td><td>4.5%</td><td>5.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>2.0%</td><td>3.0%</td><td>3.5%</td><td>4.0%</td><td>5.0%</td><td>6.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Gold</td><td>3.0%</td><td>4.0%</td><td>4.5%</td><td>5.0%</td><td>6.0%</td><td>7.

This will continue each month depending on his status and contribution levels. These amounts will grow in line with his underlying portfolio and will be paid into his fund at his selected retirement date.
11.15 LIFE PLAN OPTIMISER
The Life Plan Optimiser, as shown in your Policy Schedule, provides additional retirement benefits at your selected retirement age.
The amount of the additional benefit is paid to you yearly in advance for the rest of your life. Your entitlement to each Life Plan Optimiser instalment is dependent on your Life Plan policy being in force at the time of payment.

Content:  Your entitlement to each Life Plan Optimiser instalment is dependent on your Life Plan policy being in force at the time of payment. Life Plan Optimiser payments reduce your Life Fund as is detailed in Section 11.17.3.
Your Life Plan Optimiser will provide you with a percentage boost to your Retirement Annuity value at your selected retirement age. This boost is determined by the number of years from inception until your selected retirement date, the ancillaries on your Life Plan and the size of your Life Fund (excluding Cover and Financial Integrator).

Content: SECTION 11
You may qualify for the Purple Life Plan Optimiser Boost if you meet the following three criteria:
• The Life Plan linked to your Discovery Retirement Optimiser is a Purple Life Plan
• The Life Plan linked to your Discovery Retirement Optimiser has a Life Fund (excluding the Cover and Financial Integrators) size greater than the current amount required to qualify for the Purple Life Plan Optimiser
• Your Discovery Retirement Optimiser contribution is greater than the current amount required to qualify for the Purple Life Plan Optimiser.
Your Life Plan Optimiser Boost, together with the qualifying criteria will be shown in your Policy Schedule. Discovery will update the qualifying criteria yearly. The Life Plan Optimiser boost will then be divided by the larger of 10 or the number of years from retirement until you reach age 75, to determine the size of the instalments.
Under current tax tables, these instalments are paid tax-free.
Each instalment in retirement is increased by CPI for the years from the selected retirement date to the payment date of that instalment.
If you voluntarily reduce your Life Plan premium during retirement, your entitlement to the remaining instalments will be reduced proportionately. Similarly, a change in your Life Plan premium resulting from a claim on the ancillary benefits of the principal life will affect your entitlement to the remaining instalments (see section 11.

================================================================================

Content:  Similarly, a change in your Life Plan premium resulting from a claim on the ancillary benefits of the principal life will affect your entitlement to the remaining instalments (see section 11.17.2). Downgrading your Life Plan from a Purple Life Plan will also result in a reduction in your Life Plan Optimiser, based on the latest Life Plan Optimiser benefit tables. Similarly, a change in your Life Plan premium resulting from a claim on any of the ancillary benefits of the principal life will affect your entitlement to the remaining instalments (see Section 11.17.2).
The Life Plan Optimiser is not payable if you choose to transfer your share of the Retirement Annuity Fund for purchase of an annuity to another insurer or financial institution.
If you retire before your selected retirement date, your Life Plan Optimiser will be reduced proportionately in line with the applicable Life Plan Optimiser benefit qualifying criteria at the time.
The recalculated Life Plan Optimiser will be payable from your actual retirement age as described above.
If you defer your actual retirement age, any further build up in the value of your Life Plan Optimiser will be adjusted to take into account the increase in your term to retirement.
Reducing your contributions will also result in a proportionate reduction of your Life Plan Optimiser benefit.

11.16 THE ILL-HEALTH INCOME BOOSTER
If you are receiving an income in retirement from Discovery Invest (by means of a Discovery Invest Retirement Income Plan purchased from your Discovery Retirement Optimiser), this income will be enhanced if the principal life suffers a severe illness or disability.
This enhancement is only applicable on the occurrence of a severe illness or disability after the selected retirement age and does not apply to the occurrence of illnesses or disabilities that are related to or are a progression of an illness that occurred before the selected retirement age. The amount of the enhancement is based on the average level of income (excluding the lump sum payment at retirement) received in the 12 months before the occurrence of the illness.

Content:  The amount of the enhancement is based on the average level of income (excluding the lump sum payment at retirement) received in the 12 months before the occurrence of the illness.
Although you are not required to attach the Severe Illness Benefit or Capital Disability Benefit to your Life Fund for entitlement to this enhancement, the amount of the enhancement will be based on the severity of your illness or disability as measured by the definitions of the Severe Illness Benefit and the Capital Disability Benefit as contained in the Individual Life Plan Guide which is available from www.discovery.co.za

Content: 
If you receive an income from Discovery Invest in any year in retirement of more than 10% per year of the value of the fund at the beginning of that year, the enhancement will be capped. It will be capped based on an amount of income that would have been provided had you taken an income of 10% of the fund value at the beginning of the year in which the illness occurred.
The Ill-health Income Booster is not applied to any benefits received in retirement from the Life Plan Optimiser.
The Ill-health Income Booster is provided as long as your Life Plan remains in force. If you cancel or reduce your Life Fund or its attached benefits at any time in retirement, your current and future entitlement to the Ill-health Income Booster will be proportionately reduced.
The payment of the subsequent claim is dependent on whether the claim is progressive, related or unrelated:
• A progressive claim refers to conditions where a worsening of symptoms or stages of the disease can be expected, for example the progression of cancer, connective tissue disease or respiratory disease.

Content: 
The payment of the subsequent claim is dependent on whether the claim is progressive, related or unrelated:
• A progressive claim refers to conditions where a worsening of symptoms or stages of the disease can be expected, for example the progression of cancer, connective tissue disease or respiratory disease. A relapse of a previous cancer will be assessed as a progressive illness.
• A related claim is a claim where there is a link to a previous claim, for example, complications or consequences of a disease or injury previously claimed for. This would be where the later claim would not have arisen if it was not for the initial condition or illness. It also includes side effects or complications of treatment of the previously claimed for condition. Progressive claims are not included in this definition.
• An unrelated claim is a claim which is not related or due to the original claim.
If a severe Illness or disability arises that is related to or a progression of the current illness or disability and is more severe, the amount of the enhancement will be increased. In this case, the increased enhancement will be provided for the remaining term of the enhancement at the higher severity as shown in the table above. The remaining term is defined as the new term for which the subsequent condition qualifies, less the term for which payments were already made for the initial condition.

Content:  The remaining term is defined as the new term for which the subsequent condition qualifies, less the term for which payments were already made for the initial condition.
If during the term of the income enhancement, or within six months of the expiry of the term of the previous income enhancement, a severe Illness or disability arises that is unrelated to the previous enhancement and is more severe, the amount of the enhancement will be increased. In this case, the increased enhancement will be provided for the remaining term of the enhancement at the higher severity as shown in the table above. If an unrelated illness occurs six months or later after the expiry of the benefit enhancement term of the previous illness, a subsequent enhancement will commence based on the severity of the new illness.
The Ill-health Income Booster expires on the earlier of:
• Expiry of the benefit enhancement term
• Death
• In the case of Category D disability claims, the earlier of ceasing to work and age 65.
11.17 THE LIFE FUND
11.17.1 WHAT HAPPENS IF I STOP OR REDUCE MY DISCOVERY LIFE PLAN PREMIUMS?
• If you cancel your Life Fund before your selected retirement age or during retirement, you will not be entitled to any future benefits from the Retirement Investment Integrator, Retirement PayBack Booster, Life Plan Optimiser or Ill-health Income Booster.

Content: SECTION 11
• If you reduce your Life Plan premiums, your Discovery Retirement Optimiser benefits will be affected as follows:
a) If your new resultant Life Plan premium is below the minimum qualifying premium for the Retirement Investment Integrator at the time, you will not receive any further fee reductions from the Retirement Investment Integrator.
b) Your accrued Retirement PayBack Booster will be reduced proportionately.
c) Your Life Plan Optimiser will be recalculated. These recalculations are based on your Life Plan premium, the size of your Life Fund and attached ancillary benefits after the alteration to these benefits and the latest Life Plan Optimiser benefit tables. If you downgrade from a Purple Life Plan, your Life Plan Optimiser will further be reduced based on the latest Life Plan Optimiser benefit tables.
d) Your Ill-health Income Booster will be reduced proportionately.
11.17.2 HOW DO CLAIMS ON MY LIFE FUND AFFECT THE DISCOVERY RETIREMENT OPTIMISER?
The impact on your Discovery Retirement Optimiser will depend on whether you make claims against your Life Fund before or after your selected retirement age.
BEFORE YOUR SELECTED RETIREMENT AGE
11.17.3 HOW DO THE BENEFITS FROM THE DISCOVERY RETIREMENT OPTIMISER AFFECT MY LIFE FUND?
• If the claim results in a reduction of your Life Plan premium, you will no longer qualify for the Retirement Investment Integrator if your resultant premium is less than the minimum qualifying premium at the time.
Page Number: 143
================================================================================

Content: 
• If the claim results in a reduction of your Life Plan premium, you will no longer qualify for the Retirement Investment Integrator if your resultant premium is less than the minimum qualifying premium at the time. A reduction in your Life Plan premium will also result in a proportionate reduction of your Retirement PayBack Booster.
• If a claim occurs on any risk benefit attached to the Life Fund which results in the Life Fund terminating before your selected retirement age, there is no further entitlement to the Life Plan Optimiser and Ill-health Income Booster. If the claim arose from the spouse, the principal life will be given the option to continue the risk benefits applicable at that time without medical underwriting. Continuing with these risk benefits in full will reinstate entitlement to the Life Plan Optimiser and Ill-health Income Booster.
• If the Life Fund is reduced by a claim on an ancillary benefit of the principal life, the entitlement to the Life Plan Optimiser may be reduced. This reduction is based on the resultant ancillary take-up of your Life Plan after the claim and the Life Plan Optimiser benefit tables at the time. If these claims arose from the spouse, the Life Plan Optimiser will not be affected, unless the Life Plan premium is reduced as a result.
AFTER YOUR SELECTED RETIREMENT AGE
• On the death of the principal life in retirement, the instalments of the Life Plan Optimiser will end.

Content: 
AFTER YOUR SELECTED RETIREMENT AGE
• On the death of the principal life in retirement, the instalments of the Life Plan Optimiser will end. There will be no future entitlement to the Ill-health Income Booster.
• If the Life Fund is reduced by a claim on the ancillary benefits of the principal life, the remaining Life Plan Optimiser instalments will be adjusted proportionately based on the change in the Life Plan premium.
• AccessCover or AccessCover Plus claims will not have an impact on your Discovery Retirement Optimiser.
Benefits received from the Discovery Retirement Optimiser will reduce your Life Fund during retirement. The reductions to your Life Fund occur as follows:
• The Life Plan Optimiser is paid in yearly instalments in advance for the rest of your life in retirement and is deducted from your Life Fund when payment is made.
• The deduction from your Life Fund in any year as a result of the Life Plan Optimiser, may not exceed 4% of your Life Fund at your selected retirement age.
• The Ill-health Income Booster has no impact on your Life Fund.
• Your Life Fund will not be reduced below 50% of your Life Fund value at your selected retirement age as a result of these deductions.
All ancillary benefits attached to your Life Fund, including the Minimum Protected Fund, are also proportionately reduced as a result of the deductions described above. The Philanthropy Fund, Cover Integrator and Financial Integrator Fund will not reduce as a result of the deductions above.

11.17.4 HOW DOES THE PREMIUM WAIVER BENEFIT ON SEVERE ILLNESS AND DISABILITY AFFECT MY DISCOVERY RETIREMENT OPTIMISER CONTRIBUTIONS?
When you select the Premium Waiver Benefit on severe illness or disability, you may choose for the waiver to cover your Discovery Retirement Optimiser contributions as well. If you meet the claim criteria as defined for the Premium Waiver Benefit on severe illness or disability (as defined in sections 6 and 7 of the Individual Life Plan Guide which is available from www.discovery.co.za), the contributions to your Discovery Retirement Optimiser will be paid by Discovery Invest until the earlier of your retirement age, selected at the start of the contract, and age 65. The Premium Waiver Benefit will cover increases to a maximum of 20% per year. You will continue to qualify for the Contribution Boost while you are claiming under the Contribution Waiver.

REWARDS FOR MANAGING YOUR HEALTH
Discovery’s Life Plan is a dynamic policy, which, while it compensates you for events that influence your quality of life, also rewards you for managing and improving your health. This is achieved through Vitality and Vitality Active, which form a valuable foundation to the Life Plan.
12.1 VITALITY AND VITALITY ACTIVE
These programmes are applicable to you, provided you have chosen to join either programme through the Life Plan, or if you are already a member of either programme through a Health Plan which is on a medical scheme administered by Discovery Health. There is a monthly premium for this benefit.
These programmes are designed to encourage you to look after your health and improve your lifestyle. By improving your health, you reduce your long-term healthcare costs.
Please refer to the Vitality or Vitality Active portfolios included with your policy documents if you are a member of either of the programmes. Further information can be found on Discovery's website at www.discovery.co.za.
12.2 CAN MY VITALITY OR VITALITY ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP EXPIRE?
Yes. Your Vitality or Vitality Active membership will expire (and all benefit vouchers will be cancelled) if your premium on your Life Plan falls below the qualifying level for either membership and, in the case of members of a medical scheme administered by Discovery Health, if you resign from the medical scheme.
You have the right to cancel your Vitality or Vitality Active membership.

Content: 
You have the right to cancel your Vitality or Vitality Active membership. However, if either membership includes members who are also included on your Health Plan (on a medical scheme which is administered by Discovery Health) or Life Plan you may be required to first remove them from the Health Plan or Life Plan before you can cancel your Vitality or Vitality Active membership.
12.3 WHO QUALIFIES FOR VITALITY MEMBERSHIP?
Any person assured by your Discovery Life Plan or Health Plan (including all Health Plans in medical schemes which are administered by Discovery Health) is regarded as a dependant on your Vitality membership.
12.4 WHO QUALIFIES FOR VITALITY ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP
A principal and spouse assured on an Active Integrator Life Plan may be members of Vitality Active.

HOW TO CLAIM AND RECEIVE YOUR BENEFITS AND PAYBACKS
HOW DO I RECEIVE A BENEFIT PAYMENT?
Should you experience a life-changing event for which you are claiming a benefit payment, please contact your financial adviser or Discovery Life Claims at 0860 103 905. Discovery Life will then provide you with the necessary forms and protocols for any medical information needed.
13.1 SEVERE ILLNESS AND DISABILITY BENEFIT PAYMENTS
13.1.1 In addition to the forms and protocols required, you will also be required to provide Discovery Life with the following details within 60 days of the date of diagnosis of your severe illness or disability:
• The nature of your claim
• Other assurance products that you hold which also cover the benefits for which you are claiming.
13.1.2 Should Discovery Life reject your claim and you want to challenge the decision legally, you must do so within six months after the date of rejection. If you fail to do this, you will forfeit any potential benefit payments as a result of your claim.
13.1.3 If you travel or live outside South Africa when the claim event occurs, we will require the medical evidence issued in the foreign country to be in English to consider a claim.
13.2 DEATH CLAIMS
13.2.1 The benefit payment will be made to the nominated beneficiary or cessionary.

Content: 2.1 The benefit payment will be made to the nominated beneficiary or cessionary. The beneficiary or cessionary, or any other nominated person, such as the executor of the estate, needs to notify the financial adviser or Discovery Life’s service centre of the death claim.
13.2.2 In addition to the forms and protocols required, the beneficiary or cessionary will also be required to provide Discovery Life with the following details within 60 days of the date of death:
• The date and cause of death
• The contact person responsible for completing the documentation.
13.2.3 Should Discovery Life reject the claim and the beneficiary or cessionary wants to challenge the decision legally, the beneficiary or cessionary must do so within six months of the date of rejection. If they fail to do this, they will forfeit any potential benefit payments as a result of the claim.
13.2.4 If you travel or live outside South Africa when the claim event occurs, we will require the medical evidence issued in the foreign country to be in English to consider a claim.
13.3 WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS ON MY LIFE FUND?
The following example illustrates the effect of benefit payments on the Life Fund.
For purposes of this example, assume a Life Fund of R1 000 000 with no benefit increase options was purchased. In addition, cover for the Severe Illness Benefit and Capital Disability Benefit has also been selected.
Page Number: 147
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-531
Content:  In addition, cover for the Severe Illness Benefit and Capital Disability Benefit has also been selected. The benefit percentage for each of these benefits is 50% of the Life Fund.
13.3.1 FIRST CLAIM
Severe Illness Benefit claim: assume Severity Level D applies (ie 25%)
Your benefit payment will be calculated as follows: Benefit percentage x Severity Level x current Life Fund
= 50% x 25% x R1 000 000
= R125 000
Balance in Life Fund after claim
= R1 000 000 – R125 000
= R875 000

Content: SECTION 13
13.3.2 SECOND CLAIM
Capital Disability Benefit claim:
Category A Severity applies (ie 100%) Your benefit payment will be calculated as follows: Benefit percentage x Severity Level x current Life Fund
= 50% x 100% x R875 000
= R437 500
Please note the implications of having a Minimum Protected Fund (50% in this example). Although your Capital Disability Benefit payment would have decreased your Life Fund to below R500 000 (ie R437 500), you would receive a benefit payment of R437 500, but your Life Fund will automatically be adjusted back to R500 000 (instead of R437 500), subject to the 14-day survival rule as defined in paragraph 2.6.2.
The following graph illustrates the effect of a claim on your Life Fund:

13.4 WE WILL INVESTIGATE CLAIMS
Discovery Life reserves the right to investigate claims or await the outcome of third party investigations (such as police investigations) or the outcome of tribunals (such as judicial inquests) or tests (such as toxicology tests) and may defer its decision to refuse or admit a claim until such investigations, tribunals or tests are completed.
13.5 PAYBACKS
13.5.1 If you are eligible to receive PayBacks, these will be paid into the Policy Owner's bank account upon receiving confirmation of the bank account, which can be in the form of a bank stamped statement or letter of confirmation from the bank.

• The policy is owned by a trust or company
• The policy is a Discovery Retirement Optimiser linked policy.

13.5.5 Reinvesting your PayBacks with Discovery Invest:
You can reinvest your PayBacks into either a Discovery Retirement Optimiser through the Retirement Payback booster (see section 11.7) or through the PayBack Integrator benefit available on a lump-sum Core Retirement Plan with Discovery Invest. For more information on the PayBack Integrator benefit please refer to the Retirement Plan Fact Files on the Discovery Invest website. Please be aware that if you select the Payback Integrator on your lump-sum Core Retirement Plan, then all of your Integrator PayBacks from all your Life Plans will be reinvested in your lump-sum Core Retirement Plan. This excludes any Integrator PayBacks which are used in whole or in part by the Retirement PayBack booster benefit on any Discovery Retirement Optimiser Plan(s) that you may have.

Content: SECTION 14
CESSIONS AND BENEFICIARIES
14.1 CESSION
Your Life Plan may be ceded. This is the process where all the rights, title and interest in your Life Plan are transferred or made over to another person or entity and who becomes the new owner (in the case of an Absolute cession) or where all the rights to the benefit are transferred or made over to another person or entity (in the case of a Collateral Cession). The person who transfers the Life Plan is known as the cedent and the person or entity to whom the Life Plan is transferred is known as the cessionary.
Cessions are permitted at policy level. That means we do not allow the cession of individual benefits under the Life Plan. Please note that no cession will be valid unless the cession is recorded by Discovery Life and confirmed in writing. Any policy PayBacks and/or Buy-up Cash conversion payments will always be made to the policy owner (to the cessionary in the case of an absolute cession).
It is the responsibility of the cedent to provide the cessionary with the Policy Contract which includes the Policy Schedule and this Life Plan Guide.
There are two types of cessions.
ABSOLUTE CESSION
An absolute cession is where the cessionary takes ownership of the Life Plan and becomes liable for the payment of premiums on the policy. All rights, title and interest to the policy are permanently transferred.
Page Number: 150
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-536
Content:  All rights, title and interest to the policy are permanently transferred. The cedent has no further rights in respect of the policy and cannot deal with the policy. The prior beneficiary nominations made by the cedent will fall away (they are automatically revoked) and may be replaced by the beneficiary nominations of the cessionary, if any. Any benefit payable under the Global Education Protector and Global Health Protector will not be payable to the cessionary or their nominated beneficiary. For any other benefit payout, if no beneficiary nominations are made by the cessionary then any proceeds payable on the death of the life assured (death benefits) will be paid to the estate of the cessionary (if the cessionary and life assured are the same person) or to the cessionary as the owner. Benefits other than death benefits will be paid to the cessionary. All terms and conditions agreed to by the cedent will apply to the cessionary in relation to the policy.
Where the Income Continuation Benefit is included on a policy, an absolute cession could have adverse tax consequences. Tax advice should be sought.
No absolute cessions will be allowed on Life Plans with the Discovery Retirement Optimiser. No absolute cessions will be allowed on Life Plans with the Buy-up Cash Conversion benefit on either, or both, of the Cover and Financial Integrator Funds except in the following circumstances:
• Where the Life Assured who is the policy owner, cedes to his trust/company or vice versa.
• Where the policy is ceded to a spouse or an ex-spouse.

Content: 
• Where the policy is ceded to a spouse or an ex-spouse.
COLLATERAL CESSION
A collateral cession is where the right to death, severe illness and disability benefits in the policy are transferred to a third party as security for an unpaid debt or obligation (usually a bank). While the debt or obligation remains unpaid or outstanding the cedent remains the owner of the policy and responsible to pay premiums but cannot deal in any way with the policy without the permission of the cessionary. When the debt or obligation is settled then full ownership automatically reverts to the cedent. In the event of a life changing event that reduces the Life Fund while there is still an obligation to the cessionary, the payment will first be effected to settle any outstanding amounts owed to the cessionary. Any surplus amount will then be paid to the cedent or cedent’s beneficiary as the case may be.
After the retirement age of the principal life on a policy linked to the Discovery Retirement Optimiser the Life Fund may also be reduced by benefits paid out on the Discovery Retirement Optimiser.
The Global Education Protector, Global Health Protector, Income Continuation and Overhead Expenses Benefits and PayBack will not form any part of a collateral cession agreement.
14.2 BENEFICIARIES
You may nominate one or more beneficiaries at either policy or lives assured level to receive benefits in the event of your death, provided that:
• nominations for beneficiaries are received in writing, and submitted to Discovery Life in strict accordance with the company’s stipulated procedures.

SEVERE ILLNESS AND FAMILY BENEFITS
GENERAL PROVISIONS
• The life changing event must have occurred after the commencement of the benefit.
• Symptoms and signs must be compatible with the diagnosis and the relevant specialist investigations (including blood tests, imaging, histology and other tests) must confirm the diagnosis.
• Inability to perform Activities of Daily Living must be due to and compatible with the diagnosis of the life changing event.
• Psychiatric illness, chronic fatigue syndrome (and synonyms) and fibromyalgia (and synonyms) and related terms are not covered under the Severe Illness Benefit.
• Major organ transplant claims include being on an official South African or international transplant waiting list for the relevant transplant.
• Specialist reports are required to assess all claims. A specialist is a medical practitioner registered as a specialist with the Health Professions Council of South Africa.
• The claims definitions in the Discovery Life Severe Illness Benefit are compliant with the Standardised Critical Illness definitions Project (SCIDEP). The document is available at https://www.asisa.org.za/asisadocs/Standards/SCIDEP
• Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are defined in Appendix 5.
• Please note that claims relating to conditions which may have been identified as a result of screening tests (eg.

Content: 
• Please note that claims relating to conditions which may have been identified as a result of screening tests (eg. genetic tests) but where there are no medical symptoms or signs of the disease will not be covered under these definitions.
• Where a claim is defined for both a condition and its treatment, only the claim with the higher applicable category payout percentage will be paid. If you have selected the LifeTime Severe Illness benefit, any LifeTime Severity upgrades that either the claim or the treatment qualify for will be taken into account when determining the total payout percentage.
1. CANCER BENEFIT
Cancer is a malignant tumour characterised by the uncontrolled growth of cells, invasion of normal tissue and spread to distant organs. The term malignant tumour includes leukaemia, lymphoma and sarcoma.
Pre-malignancy and carcinoma-in-situ tumours (also known as non-invasive cancers) except for carcinoma-in-situ of the breast treated by mastectomy are not covered under this benefit. However, a list of in situ cancers are covered in Appendix 2, under the Early Cancer Benefit. Brain tumours are covered under the Nervous System Benefit. Specified neuroendocrine tumours are covered under the Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Benefit.
A current internationally recognised staging system will be used to assess the claim.
Page Number: 154
================================================================================
Section ID: file-Discovery_life_plan_pdf-446973636F76657279206C69666520706C616E2E706466-page-547
Content: 
A current internationally recognised staging system will be used to assess the claim.
A report from the treating specialist, including the histology and stage of the cancer, the relevant imaging reports and other tests must confirm the diagnosis. A liquid biopsy and cell free DNA without histological evidence of invasive cancer cannot be considered for a claim. A specialist is a person registered as such with the Health Professions Council of South Africa in a relevant speciality.
Multiple cancer claims for related cancers will be assessed as progressive claims (see section 6.15 for more information on how subsequent severe illness claims are paid). A related cancer is regarded as a cancer of the same tissue and organ, for example breast cancer progressing from stage 1 to stage 2. Once a payment for a cancer listed under Severity A has been made, further claims will only be considered for an unrelated cancer, unless the Lifetime Max option has been selected. This option includes the Cancer Relapse Benefit (Section 6.15.1.1).
An unrelated cancer is a cancer that is not regarded as being of the same tissue or the same organ. An example would be breast cancer followed by a diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Transformation of a cancer or heterogeneity of a tumour on molecular grounds will not be regarded as an unrelated cancer. An unrelated cancer will be identified as a second primary cancer and will be regarded as a unrelated claim and a new life changing event.

Content:  An unrelated cancer will be identified as a second primary cancer and will be regarded as a unrelated claim and a new life changing event. Progression of the new primary cancer will be assessed as a progressive claim. Payments for unrelated cancers will be subject to the Minimum Protected fund (if applicable) and the limits of the Life Fund as well as the terms of the Classic, Purple and Essential Life Plan payment rules.
Please refer to the flowchart in Appendix 11 for a summary of how cancer claims under the Severe Illness Benefit are assessed and paid.

3. NERVOUS SYSTEM BENEFIT
The claimant must be treated by a neurologist or neurosurgeon registered as such with the Health Professions Council of South Africa.
This benefit covers specified conditions of the brain, spinal cord nerves and arteries to the brain.
Stroke is defined as death of brain tissue due to inadequate blood supply or haemorrhage within the skull resulting in neurological deficit lasting longer than 24 hours, confirmed by neuro-imaging investigation and appropriate clinical findings by a specialist neurologist. Symptoms and signs as well as imaging (Computerised Tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) must confirm a new stroke. Transient ischaemic attacks are specifically excluded.
A Severity D payment will be paid on receipt of objective medical evidence from the treating neurologist confirming the diagnosis of an acute stroke with full recovery. In the event that the claimant has persistent neurological impairment 14 days after the event, the payment will be made and a further assessment of the stroke claim will be made on receipt of a full specialist neurologist’s report three months after the stroke.
Neurological deficits and ADL Impairments must be compatible with the diagnosis and objective medical evidence.

13. INTENSIVE CARE AND MULTI-ORGAN BENEFIT
Intensive Care Benefit
This benefit covers Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay for various durations.
The claimant must be treated by a specialist in a recognised trauma or intensive care unit. The Intensive care unit must be a recognised ICU unit as defined by the Critical Care Society of South Africa.
Please note that, if the ICU stay criteria are met, then in the case of the ICU stay:
• Being related to any other Severe Illness Benefit claims criteria claimed under,
• Starting within 30 days after the claimant becomes eligible for any other Severe Illness claims criteria claimed under,
• Ending within 30 days before the claimant becomes eligible for any other Severe Illness claims criteria claimed under,
Then only the highest severity claim event will be paid for (and not the sum of the payments of the ICU and the other claim event).
For example, if the client is admitted to ICU 27 days after a 3-vessel CABG and stays in ICU for eight days with assisted invasive mechanical ventilation for five days, then only the Severity B CABG will be paid, and not the Severity D ICU benefit.

chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant or radiotherapy.
Furthermore, children who suffer any of the specified cancers below will be paid out the higher of the corresponding Severity and the normal staging Severity under Section 1 above.
DEFINITION
SEVERITY A
Diagnosis of a condition resulting in global developmental delay confirmed by poor performance in two or more of the following developmental domains:
- Motor
- Speech and language
- Cognition and personal
- Social and daily living skills
- Poor performance is defined as two standard deviations below the norm or equivalent.
Childhood Cancer
Autism spectrum disorder
Diagnosis and assessment of Autism Level 3 (requiring very substantial support) in social communication or interaction Severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social interactions; minimal response to social overtures from others
Examples include:
- Non-existent communication, no attempts to share thoughts or interests or make requests
- Communication consists only of physical gestures with no eye contact or spoken language
- Communication that consists of words that are repeated from other contexts for example echolalia
AND
Repetitive or restrictive behaviour that requires very substantial support
Behaviours significantly interfere with function in all spheres; extreme difficulty coping with changes; great distress or difficulty changing focus or action.
Examples include:
- Rocking or spinning the body, objects, flapping hands
- Engaging in unusual sensory exploration such as sniffing or mouthing objects
- Rigid adherence to routines that interferes with functional activities
The diagnosis and assessment of the severity level must be confirmed by a child neurologist, child psychiatrist or development pediatrician.

ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING
The Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is an internationally used scoring system that assesses the functional ability of a person including the physical, cognitive and interactive abilities. Discovery Life uses the ADLs to assess functioning in both the Severe Illness and Capital Disability Benefits when objective criteria of Impairment are needed – for example when neurological and connective tissue diseases as specified in Appendix 1 and 4 are assessed. Changes to the ADLs must be permanent, must have occurred after the date of commencement of the policy, and must be due to the condition, illness or event that is being claimed for.
Discovery Life reserves the right to request an Occupational Therapist’s or Neuropsychologist’s assessment of ADL functioning, using standardised assessment methods.
THERE ARE SIX CATEGORIES OF ADLS:
• Self-care
• Communication
• Physical Activity
• Sensory Function
• Hand Function
• Advanced Activities.
SCORING OF THE CATEGORIES:
The terms ‘no impairment’, ‘moderately impaired’, ‘severely impaired’ and ‘very severely impaired’ are used in the Advanced Activities category.

Content: APPENDIX 14
HOW DISCOVERY LIFE ASSESSES YOUR HEALTH CLAIMS
Discovery Life considers your submitted claims, as per the date the claims are processed by Discovery Health for any medical scheme which is administered by Discovery Health, over the previous 12 month period preceding the three months before your policy anniversary. If there are less than 12 months of claims, for example at three months prior to the first anniversary, the submitted claims will be pro-rated to account for the shorter period.
The submitted claims taken into account on the Health Plan (on a medical scheme which is administered by Discovery Health) include:
• All claims submitted by you or your medical service provider, without any qualification that they were paid or were submitted to be paid.
• Chronic medicine and in-hospital benefits (excluding childbirth claims and colonoscopy claims for lives over the age of 50) including other risk benefits paid by your medical scheme attributable to the principal life and spouse insured under the Life Plan. In the case of the Priority Plan, the claims taken into account include the amount of the hospital deductibles payable by the member.
• Medical expenses (on all Health Plans except for the Core Plan) accumulating towards and above the Above Threshold Benefit if your Health Plan includes the Above Threshold Benefit, or what would have accumulated towards and above the Above Threshold Benefit if your Health Plan does not include the Above Threshold Benefit. These medical expenses will be taken into account at the rates at which they accumulate (or would have accumulated) towards and above the Above Threshold Benefit.
